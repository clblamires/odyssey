<p>10 days to Wakening Sun, Goloris, 6 days remaining</p>



<p>I woke up back in my room on the Gjallarhorn. Someone must have brought me back, but I was alone with Telavasir. I am utterly exhausted. The magic water did something to me. The effect is gone, at least according to Tel. She doesn’t sense anything different. But I <em>feel</em> different. I don’t know how to describe it.</p>



<p>I found the others on the top deck as our crew rowed us out of the Mirror Prison. Brachydios was leading us towards the only other island that Dante remembered - that solitary island with the large statues. No one was very thrilled to go there, but we didn’t know where else to go. Brachy (can I call him that?) said it was relatively safe, though. Khar’shan would likely not be there, and that seemed alright to the rest of us.</p>



<p>The ship moored off the coast of the statue island and we rowed over to it. It’s eerie here, unsettlingly quiet. Our footsteps on the rocky shore are the loudest things here, apart from our own quickened heartbeats. </p>



<p>The statues, colossal in size, were before us. There were three of them, one of a woman and two of men, all muscular, and all with fear in their eyes. Large rusted shackles and chains bound them to the land, though that seems unnecessary. </p>



<p>Clio told us, “They are not statues. These are their siblings.”</p>



<p>She meant the Twin Titans. In their thirst for power, Amalj’aa and Khar’shan captured their siblings, binding or cursing them in some horrible way. In this case, both. </p>



<p>To our surprise, including Brachydios’s, one of the statues moved. Well, barely moved. Only his eyes and neck could move, and even that was exceedingly limited. Centuries of dust fell from his head as it gazed on us. “Who approaches?” he asked, his voice low and raspy.</p>



<p>Clio answered, “We are the Dragonlords.”</p>



<p>The titan shook its head slightly, painfully. “I know not what ye mean… Speak plainly. Who are ye?”</p>



<p>We nodded and urged Clio to continue. She replied, “Warriors, here to kill Khar’shan and save the Emerald Isles.”</p>



<p>His eyes lit up at that. “Khar’shan… aye, the sister… The Twins betrayed us… imprisoned us… Ye come to slay the sister? Then… I shall help ye…”</p>



<p>His eyes closed for a moment. Clio offered to help him in some way in recompense for his aid, but the titan declined. He said that the death of the Twins was vengeance, and that would suffice. He told us to beware of the waters, that they were made of primordial magic from the creation of Xerender. Even magic to alter it could cause unknown effects. </p>



<p>But on these waters was Khar’shan’s barge, a lofty and elegant ship pulled by another titan, another imprisoned by the Twins. Khar’shan had a spell on her barge, though: none can find it unless she wills them to. What we needed, the stone titan said, was a way to summon her, to draw her attention.</p>



<p>The way to do it is challenging. The titan told us of various cubes hanging from the impossibly high ceiling of the Nether Sea. They are prison cubes, whose inmates are the primal monsters of the world. One of those monsters already escaped its specialized prison: the Primal Tide from the Mirror Prison. The prison cubes house <em>other</em> monsters.</p>



<p>Our idea is to go into one of those prison cubes and see if we can somehow draw her attention. The titan said the primal monsters are trapped in there for a reason: they are a threat to the Twins. Should Khar’shan think that one of them is getting out, she will come to investigate. </p>



<p>The titan’s gaze turned skyward into the impossible dark above us. “One cube hangs yonder, adrift on chains that moor it to the hells above. Ye must sail and find them. Look for the chains. But mark me well, Dragonlords: the cube is sealed. A word gains ye entrance, not writ, not spoken, but <em>known</em>. I may gift it to one among ye, but know this: knowing is no light burden. To hold it in thy mind is to invite the whispering, the bending, the slow unmaking of thy senses. Madness shall call thee while thou knowest.”</p>



<p>Madness? Okay, we’ve dealt with that before. I got a little funny on the Island of Time, but it wasn’t anything Briar couldn’t fix, right? But no, Briar told us she’s a little winded from the fight against that wretched ghost, and because of that she won’t be able to cast her restoration spell.But good news! Clio has a restoration spell stored in her magic ring! So here’s how we decided to do it: Clio would have the titan teach her the word. If she goes crazy, I’ll use the ring to help her. That’s a great plan! There’s no way that could go wrong!</p>



<p>And before we even told the titan our plan, the titan grumbled, “It is done.”</p>



<p>Clio seemed… well… I guess it’s not too different from what I was babbling when I got all weird a few weeks ago. Nothing she was saying made any sense. She started talking about strange things, but otherwise didn’t seem too alarmed. I asked her if she felt okay and she said cucumber. That seems alright, though. Cucumbers are healthy, so we took it to mean she was going to be alright. </p>



<p>The titan continued, “Beware, Dragonlords. Ye tread a path steeped in folly should ye seek the sister with steel and mithral in hand. She lays in cruel delight and is a creature of jest now. Ye would do well to laugh, even when laughter rings hollow. Laugh, lest she take up her needle and sew thy mouths shut. The sister favors games, still. If ye must tempt the Fates and play the Royal Game, let her win. Let her win, O Dragonlords. Madness claimed her in an age long ago, and the brother... He sought to mend her mind by forging weapons from the madness itself. Should ye find such weapons, wield them with care. They cut not flesh alone, but the soul.”</p>



<p>With that, the titan turned his head slowly back to the sky, closed his eyes, and moved no more.</p>



<p>And now, we’re off towards a prison cube. Gods, I hate this place. Everything the titan said is just awful. And poor Clio! Her mental faculties are just as keen as ever, but she cannot speak to us now. Leu is trying to interpret, but we found it best to just ask yes and no questions. I have her ring, though. If things get bad, I will cure her. It will be alright.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>There it is: a massive metal cube, just as the titan had said, hanging from the darkness above us on silent chains. As we got closer, poor Clio thought she heard whispers, disturbing echoes. It wasn’t just her, though. We all started hearing it, like a low rumble or a high whisper, or both. It’s hard to tell, but we’re almost certain the whispers are coming from the cube. </p>



<p>We sailed around it, looking for a door, but we found none. In fact, the entire cube is entirely featureless, save for massive runes carved on each of the faces. These are old runes, too. Clio’s got a mind for reading these sort of things, but even she didn’t know what they were. On top of the cube, barely visible from down here in the water, is what looks like an enormous hourglass with over half its sand expended. I flew up onto the top of the cube to get a better look while the others kept searching for entrances. There’s some sort of mechanical device on the hourglass, like a claw. I puzzled over the hourglass for a time, jotting down some notes and doing some quick math in my head, before gliding down to the others. </p>



<p>I told them what I saw and found out: to me, it looks like there are maybe three whole centuries of sand still in the top of the hourglass. My math might be wrong, but the sand was flowing steadily and slowly and I’m almost certain of the time. I guessed there might be about six or seven centuries of sand in the bottom half, expended time. What did that mean?</p>



<p>Clio seemed to have an idea, but she couldn’t say it. I gave her my journal, and this is what she wrote:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_oVi4sTzaOqc3-rLsgr2wpGAp7KWS_KXOmbgcT2v3UtgfzDIKUN5Xu6gcoy_WGIpyOHqmeUhsL1nxXCHsX2UKwYR8eckIvZSZLgyBgO4DvP2txecFK2WW9w3Jm9Xiav6An0k0Fw?key=e7F84_CRcpdA7G8NTm1fxFPl" alt="I left the iron on today and almost burned myself" style="width:630px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>Huh. I mean... what? The hourglass has something to do with... fire and burning? Briar uses the iron to help us press our clothes so we look presentable when talking to island leaders and chiefs. Should we press something hot to the-</p>



<p>Nope. Turns out, that was just the madness again! I cast the restoration spell on Clio. We figured it was worth it to get her insight on this, and I’m glad we did. Clio agreed with me on the timeline of the sand (yes!) and then clarified to us all what it really meant: the prison cubes have a timed mechanism on them that will <em>release the inhabitants when the hourglass runs empty</em>. Then she told us what she truly feared about this cube: we know that there are five other primals beside the one we met, the Primal Tide: Dawn, Tempest, Hunger, Death, and Calamity. Of all of them, the legends of the Primal Calamity are the worst. We must under no circumstances release whatever is inside this prison. Even the slightest chance the prisoner is the Primal Calamity, we cannot risk it. The other primals will certainly bring ruin and chaos to the Emerald Isles, but the Primal Calamity has the power to unmake them entirely.</p>



<p>What’s worse is that the prison was sealed about seven hundred years ago, long before the war between the Dragonlords and the Twin Titans and the fey. There is no history of that time, no books or tales. We have no way of knowing what is inside the cube.</p>



<p>Where does that leave us? We all came to an agreement: we need to find a way into this cube and see what is imprisoned here. We should do whatever we can to get Khar’shan’s attention, but that must not involve releasing the prisoner. The fate of the world is already in our hands, and we cannot add this to the load.</p>



<p>We briefly considered visiting the Island of the Oathbreakers, just in case there was a way to get Khar’shan’s attention there. The Island of Oathbreakers here is different than what I expected. Those that break the Oath of Guest Friendship or are exiled are taken to the Island of the Exiles up in the Cerulean Gulf. Those that break any other oath, including Oaths of Service, are taken to the island here in the Nether Sea instead. The island is where the Furies live, I guess. Should we go there and see if we can convince the Furies to aid us against Khar’shan? But no, we decided against it. The Furies are neutral to everything but their laws. So long as the Twin Titans are not breaking oaths, the Furies have no reason to fight them.</p>



<p>That leaves the prison cube, then. </p>



<p>There’s no entrance on the sides. We are sure of it. There is no entrance on the bottom, either. The cube sits almost perfectly on the waters, and none of us are willing to swim underneath to try to find a door down there. That leaves the top. I flew up with Briar and Actaeon to look around. Actaeon let down and rope and Father, Clio, and Torag joined us, along with all our dragons. Rendu stayed on the ship below to help the crew defend the Gjallarhorn from any unseen threats.</p>



<p>Father found the door on a small corner of the cube. How do we open-</p>



<p>-and it’s open! Clio said something weird, something we thought was gibberish from the madness again, and then the door slid open. Clio kind of blinked a bit. Apparently now that she said it, she forgot the word! That’s a good thing then!</p>



<p>Father led us in, down some stairs into pure darkness. He slipped on his head a helmet from the treasures of the Dragonlords in the Mirror Prison, and he vanished into the shadows. Neat trick! But I can’t see in here, so I lit my lantern. It was at that point that we discovered his shadow helmet conceals not only himself, but anyone standing near him. My lantern couldn’t pierce the darkness, so in darkness we stayed.</p>



<p>And then, we heard a BOOM. Shadow called out and stepped aside. My lantern lit the room finally. There were two large golems, like statues, lumbering towards us. Shadow’s arrows bounced off them, sparking slightly from his lightning magic. Torag lit up his sword and attacked, the black flames scorching and chipping away at the creatures. Actaeon’s axe didn’t do anything at all to them. They didn’t even flinch! The golems charged and began swinging, wild punches striking against us. Torag stood his ground, though, defending us all. </p>



<p>Clio had an idea. Her psionic powers couldn’t <em>hurt</em> the golems, but she could certainly use them to <em>hold</em> the golems. With her cool mind powers, she pinned one golem to the ceiling while the rest of us beat the other into pieces. Briar and I quickly discovered that radiant and fire magic could harm them, and the first golem was soon shattered into pieces. Clio let down the other, and we did the same.</p>



<p>But now, where do we go? Even with my lantern, everything is so dark in here. Father found two doors out of this room, but we were afraid of finding more golems or worse behind each of them. He asked me, “Hey, do you think Kiora can help us out here?” I figured it was worth a shot. </p>



<p>I went to praying, casting my rituals, listening to the sounds of the silent goddess. The others patched themselves up from the golem fight, waiting quietly until a vision came to me.</p>



<p>Go left.</p>



<p>Then... go left.</p>



<p>Then... go... </p>



<p>Really? Left? Just... go left?</p>



<p>Alright, I guess that was very clear. Kiora’s vision told me to stay to the left, wherever we are. The others were a little dumbfounded, but Kiora hasn’t steered me wrong yet. We trusted in her, and it worked out very well for us because of that trust.</p>



<p>To the left was a large room with a pit below us. The pit was filled with... worms. Like... huge, purple worms, all wriggling about, over and under each other. Absolutely disgusting. You’d have liked it, Heath. I was never sure why you thought worms were cool. Above the pit was a very narrow bridge, and across it was another stone golem. It turned as we entered, and it charged.</p>



<p>Get it, Actaeon!</p>



<p>Actaeon charged, shouting a battle cry as he brandished his magic spear. The golem met him in the center of the bridge, and Actaeon swiftly knocked it over, sending the golem tumbling into the pit of weird gross worms. We cheered until we saw the golem <em>standing on top of the worms and trying to climb out of the pit</em>.</p>



<p>I heard Briar say, “Oh, absolutely not!” She raised her fire staff and threw a blast of fire. It scorched the worms, incinerating most of them, and the golem fell down. It stood up and tried to climb again, but it was no use - the bridge was too high. It jumped, grasping at the edge, but as it did, Torag and Actaeon stabbed and speared until it was broken into pieces, dead on the ground.</p>



<p>Where to? Kiora said go left. And we did. Then we took another left. Then another. I thought we might end up in a circle, but instead we found a long hallway with three doors. We went to the door on the left. This led to a long shaft with a lever and a steel door at the end. Shadow went in, cautious and courageous. After a moment, he called out. “Nothing here! I think it’s safe. I’ll hit the lever.”</p>



<p>Just as we were about to step into the room, an unseen door slammed in front of us and we heard the sound of locks. Shadow cried out in the room, but we couldn’t get to him. Actaeon and Torag began beating on the heavy door, but it wouldn’t budge. There was coughing on the other side. Then a click, and a click, and a click. The door opened, and Father fell out of the room, gasping for air.</p>



<p>“Poison!” he cried when he caught his breath. “The room was filled with poison. As soon as I hit that lever, it happened.” He showed what was in his hands: a lock-picking kit! “Good thing I brought this with me,” he laughed.</p>



<p>We looked into the poison room, watching the green gas float in the air. Another click, then a hum, and we saw a series of holes open on the ground. The gas, heavier than our breathable air, drifted into the holes and out of sight. </p>



<p>And then... the monsters.</p>



<p>There were fearsome cries, roars, almost screams, from down below us. The poison had awoken it. Or <em>them</em>. There were many sounds, not just one. Two? Three? Maybe. Their roars were deafening.</p>



<p>They began slamming against the walls of their prison, and the cube shook violently. It swayed back and forth on its chains, metal groaning against metal. We collapsed onto the floor, unable to keep our balance.</p>



<p>“We have to go!” someone cried, but I don’t know who. We scrambled back out the way we came in, catching each other as the rocking of the cube caused us to topple. Up the stairs we ran until we were back on top of the prison cube. The chains above us, impossibly big, were vibrating with each slam from the imprisoned monsters. Dust and rock collapsed from some above, unknown source.</p>



<p>And in the distance, we heard something new. Something frightening. A long, sullen horn, bellowing in the vast darkness around us.</p>



<p>She is coming.</p>
