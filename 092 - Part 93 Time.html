<p><em>2 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 25 days remaining</em></p>



<p>The second roar rang in our ears, the island seemingly coming alive as it did. The thick chains reaching up into the heavens resonated with the sound, and the ground vibrated beneath our feet. The air felt stagnant suddenly, as if we were being watched as we trespassed on the island. We debated whether or not we should even bother with going to the overlook. Was it worth it? We had what we needed. Clio had Leusinia’s egg, and I had the Book of Life. What other plans did we have? But Actaeon was insistent. His former comrade, Luis Dante, was asleep at the stone table, and he meant to figure out why.</p>



<p>We made it to the north shore of the island where a green cliff looked out upon a sea of stars both above and beneath us. In the center of the cliff was a large stone platform, razed by time, and on it was a bronze telescope that gazed into the void. </p>



<p>Should we look into it? Briar remembered her divination: looking through the telescope more times than fingers on your hand (minus the thumb) would put someone into the throws of madness. So she put a protective spell on me and I dared a glance.</p>



<p>It was Ellandyr, just as expected! The jewel of the sea, Ellandyr stood proud and tall, the same as I remember it before our journey on the sea began. On the walls were the banners of Acastus the traitor and his wife, the god queen Aminatou. Fishing vessels were in the port, all waiting their turn to go out into the sea for the day. The colossus stood proud over the city, casting its protective gaze away from the bustling city. </p>



<p>Torag frowned and he gazed through the telescope next. He described something different, though. He said the buildings were taller, newer. The walls were adorned with garlands and flowers. And in the center of the city, he beheld statues of each of us, the Dragonlords, surrounded by grateful citizens. Torag told us this, then turned to Actaeon, “I’m sorry, brother. We won’t find anything to help your friend.”</p>



<p>Actaeon looked distressed. At least, I think so. It’s hard to tell when he’s always wearing a helmet that hides his face so well. He stepped forward and looked through the telescope this time. “Yeah, that’s Ellandyr,” he said, nodding. “It’s weird, though.” He described the city as being absolutely destroyed, wrecked. It seemed to him that the city had separated from the mainland and was drifting away to sea somehow. Large monsters, demons perhaps, were sifting through the wreckage. He couldn’t see any statues of us.</p>



<p>Was this the future? We pondered it, but I ultimately decided that couldn’t be the case. I suggested that it was one possible future. The view Torag saw was one where we were heroes and we had saved the Emerald Isles. But what Actaeon saw was one of ruin. Could both come to pass?</p>



<p>No, that cannot be. If we are slain by the titans, then what Torag saw would never come to pass. These aren’t the future. They <em>can be</em><strong><em> </em></strong>the future. Which means when we slay the titans and save Ellandyr, we are not finished. We are heroes. We are the Dragonlords! When we slay the titans, we will continue to watch over our city.</p>



<p>I’m never going back to Ylisse, am I? </p>



<p>Perhaps that is for the best. What is back there for me? Nothing, not anymore. You aren’t there. Mother is here. Gods, even the Morninglord doesn’t answer my prayers now. Kiora has been with me all this time. I’ll never see those white shores and those lush forests ever again, the places we played as children. The towns and the villages with their simple problems and simpler people. It’s just a distant memory for me now.</p>



<p>Whoa, things got real for a second there! Focus, Flee, focus!</p>



<p>We decided to get out of here. The third roar was imminent and whatever was coming was going to be brutal. Our time on the Island of Time had already been too long. Convincing Actaeon to leave the island was not easy. We had no solution for Luis Dante. Maybe someday we can return and help him?</p>



<p>Torag smelled it first before any of us had any notion that something was amiss. The third roar came, right behind us. It was right there, this large androsphinx, the creature that called itself the Sovereign of Time. The world melted around us, eerily into a hellish landscape of blood and stars.</p>



<p>We found ourselves on a series of rocks, revolving around a central spherical stone. Large, brain-like creatures with writhing tentacles, were upon us before we could really take in the horrors here. The tentacles of the brain near me wrapped me up and began to drag me to the edge of the stones, evidently intent on letting me fall into the pit of stars beneath me. I cast a spell of fire onto the brain to get it to release me, and I flapped hard on the wings of my shoes. Under absolutely no circumstances will I be falling off any cliffs today, especially into spooky starry oblivion!</p>



<p>Actaeon and Malkarion fought off the brains on them, Shadow and Yzzy did the same. Clio and Torag both managed to protect themselves well enough. Dromoka spat acid at the brain attacking me. Briar was hurt briefly until Zirconis put it to sleep with his magical dragon breath. Rendu unfortunately was paralyzed by the brain near him and it began to drag him to his doom, but not before Briar cast a healing spell on him, neutralizing whatever poisons it had hurt him with. </p>



<p>Rendu, feeling much stronger now, drew out the black longsword he kept strapped to his back, and he slashed it down in a violent splash of radiant energy, cleaving one of the brains in twain. Actaeon did the same. But as we celebrated that victory, we looked on in dismay as Clio and Torag and Shadow were now being dragged toward the edge of infinity. Torag, unfortunately, fell and disappeared. Clio almost did too before I cast a healing spell on her, bringing her back to her senses. Shadow, escaping his grapple, tugged on the brain trying to throw Clio to her doom and helped bring her back up. The last of the brains were killed, and we cried out, wondering what had become of Torag.</p>



<p>We didn’t get a chance to mourn. The Sovereign of Time was soon upon us, appearing on the planetoid in the center of the ring of rocks, and he roared. As he did, Torag reappeared on a rock to the side. I don’t know how he did it, but he was there! He was greatly injured, though. </p>



<p>Not thinking, I cast a spell of silence onto the Sovereign. The roaring ceased briefly, and it glared at me. I shrank back as Rendu stood in front of me, shielding me from whatever was probably coming next. The Sovereign vanished from my zone of silence and appeared next to me and the others, roaring anew. </p>



<p>Briar hit it with a blighting spell, but it had little effect. Torag and Shadow were shaken by the roaring and neither could do anything. Actaeon launched his axe from afar, trying to damage the monster as it clawed at us. Shadow was hurt, and Clio’s magic was completely ineffective against it. </p>



<p>Rendu flew on his wings straight into the Sovereign and began hacking with his magically charged sword. We tried to back him up, but the Sovereign did something… I don’t know what exactly… but the ground beneath our feet began to glow with energy, and our heads began to swim. I backed off, throwing a web of fire onto the monster, but to little effect. The others tried to back away, too, but they couldn’t escape. As Rendu brought down his sword again, a flash of light exploded. We thought Rendu slew the Sovereign, but that was not the case. Rather, the Sovereign caused the ground beneath our feet to turn to dust in an instant. And Clio, Rendu, Ysgramor, and Dromoka tumbled down into the pit of stars beneath us, disappearing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what came over me. This island, this <em>hell</em>, keeps taking things from me. It took my sanity when I was trying to watch my step. It took my brother, Actaeon, when that hierocosphinx tried to drop him off a cliff. And now it’s taken my… </p>



<p>My gauntlet erupted with lightning that I transmuted into a fiery storm of fury, and I singed the Sovereign of Time. He turned to me, surprised, as I shouted, “I can do that again, you horror. Give me back my family!” But he did nothing. He just simply stared at me, almost amused. I had his attention, and he didn’t see the javelin of lightning come from Actaeon. The javelin pierced his neck with a wash of power, and the world instantly began to spin.</p>



<p>We were laying on the ground, the strange blue grass tickling our injured bodies. There we were, but not all. Clio and Rendu and Dromoka and Ysgramor were still missing. The Sovereign of Time stood above us, perfectly uninjured and laughing. </p>



<p>“Well done, mortals, well done,” he said, his voice deep and causing our hearts to stutter.</p>



<p>Briar and I rose up to our feet first, and I leveled my gauntlet at him. I think I was still full of adrenaline, and (perhaps foolishly) I threatened him, “Where are they, you filth?”</p>



<p>The Sovereign only chuckled at my measly threat. “My, my, you are a serious bunch. Your comrades are fine,” he said, turning to look up at the stars above him. “None has bested me in nearly nine centuries. You all did rather well. And now, we shall feast. Follow me.”</p>



<p>None of us moved for a moment, and we each struggled to comrephend what had just happened. He said they were fine. Why didn’t that feel right? We did as we were told (again, perhaps foolishly) and followed him.</p>



<p>The journey to the stone table took less time, and I’m not sure why. I never lowered by gauntlet, except when I finally saw Clio, Rendu, Yzzy, and Dromoka, all sleeping at the stone table next to the others. The table was full of food, many kinds I had never seen before, or even heard of before. </p>



<p>But we didn’t move, as our friends were still asleep. “Wake them!” I ordered, my voice cracking. The Sovereign of Time regarded me almost playfully. He took a razor-sharp paw and gently nudged Clio. Her eyes blinked, and Briar and I dashed over to her, holding her in our arms. </p>



<p>But Clio was babbling. She wasn’t herself. She was mumbling and her eyes darted around her, afraid.</p>



<p>And I raised my gauntlet back to the Sovereign again, furious.</p>
