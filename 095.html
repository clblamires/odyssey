<p><em>10 to Verdant Sun, Goloris, 22 days remaining</em></p>



<p>I feel like I was missing some pretty serious context when it came to oaths in the Emerald Isles. The way I understood it, oaths were binding contracts between people. You know, like <em>normal oaths</em>. I could say to someone, "I swear an oath that I will buy you roast duck for lunch today" and it is perfectly fine. But in the Emerald Isles, let's say I swear that oath but I forget or change my mind. Like, I don't want to get roast duck; it's too expensive. <strong>BOOM</strong> the furies take you to the Island of Exiles. And... that's it.</p>



<p>I'm kind of shaking right now thinking about the two oaths I made since I've been here. The Oath of Friendship with my friends was the first one, where we swore to share kindness with one another, remain loyal, to listen and be heard, and to respect one another. It was our way of sharing our toils and triumphs. I thought it was just a nice thing to do. After having traveled with these people for months, I'm certain we are friends and we remain loyal to one another, but now I'm imagining the consequences of being cross with one another.</p>



<p>The second oath I made was to Vanadon-Necroth, an oath of service. I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I did this. The armor I wear has protected me and granted me wonderful boons, and I don't think I would have made any other decision if I had to do it all over again. But look at me, foolish little Flee, not asking "Sure I can oath you some service. What do you want me to do?" What if Vanadon-Necroth was, you know, like a jerk or something? What if the service he wanted was for me to kill a man? Or steal from a temple? Or... I don't know, kick Briar?</p>



<p>I consider myself very lucky in a lot of respects, including the many ways I've almost died over the last few months. But I'm especially lucky that the oaths I swore weren't super scary. Seriously, when we kill the titans and save the world and all that stuff, the first thing I'm doing is creating an immigration presentation to help newcomers figure out what the heck is going on around here. "Welcome to the Emerald Isles! Enjoy your stay, take in the sights, and don't ever say the word 'oath'!"</p>



<p>We're all a little disturbed that Helios attacked us. I mean, I get it, <em>I'm a snack</em>, right? Actually, on that idiom, I apparently confused all of my friends with that one. For one to be a snack, one is considered attractive. While I don't believe that for a minute about myself, I thought the word-play was funny. No one else got it. Bah! Father asked Notus if he knew anything about it, but Notus was just as surprised as the rest of us. Helios, a dragon who has lived here a long time, should have known better.</p>



<p>At some point while we continued to line our pockets with snacks and food from Helios's table, Actaeon called out. He felt something down below the temple and thought it might be Helios's dragon hoard. There was a defensive spell on it but Briar and I managed to dispel it. The floor collapsed and Actaeon fell down (not far, he has flying boots). There was a tunnel directly underneath us!</p>



<p>What's more is I felt something, something strange and forceful. Something immense, enough to make my soul cry out. And I just... I understood it now. When Clio's mind was past the lesser sphinx. When Briar jumped into fire. When Actaeon waded through the Blightwing's ichor. When Torag explored the caves of the Fates. When Shadow learned of the gift from the Five on our own ship. It's... It's like a hum. Not one I could hear. It was like a resonance in my chest. My breath caught and for a moment the whole world seemed to slow around me. Everything faded into a gentle blur, everything but <em>the egg</em>. </p>



<p>It was in the dragon's hoard in the chamber below us. I flew down, though I let myself be restrained by my friends to make sure I didn't do anything dangerous. There, we saw a heap of gold and platinum and silver, everything that Helios had amassed as part of him being a dragon. All this treasure, this conduit for Helios's energy, was here, and the egg was beneath it. Briar cast a spell, one that channeled wind, to help move the coins and uncover it. And then, there it was!</p>



<p>The egg was like the sun, bright and radiant, and a warmth spread from it and into me. The warmth went through every inch of my body and it came with a feeling of comfort. As clear as a bell, I heard her name: Telavasir. The name of my dragon! I had known it all my life. It wasn't learned, it wasn't given - it simply <em>was</em>, written into Telavasir's soul, and mine. I knelt above her egg, and in that moment, <em>I got it</em>. Everything made sense to me, how the others felt enraptured by their dragons and their bond. This one was mine. This wasn't just a dragon. It was a bond, a destiny intertwined with mine. </p>



<p>Naturally, I couldn't carry Telavasir's egg. It's too heavy and I didn't eat do any pushups today. Shadow offered to carry it for me while the others looked through the treasures. I did my best to distract myself from the pull in my chest to sit with the egg, to mother it, to protect it. She was fine for now and I had other things to think about. Things like the fact that I missed Torag jumping down the tunnel, nearly sixty feet tall, without breaking a sweat. Or the fact that Actaeon with his winged shoes carried Father down like a princess. I'm sure it was adorable, and I'm so mad I missed it!</p>



<p>Briar tried to detect the magic around us and found a few points of interest. There's some strange things here in Helios's hoard. We found a weird clock, one that seems to be counting down to something. It has a few clock faces on it and one appears to be broken. There's also an atlas bound in wyvern hide, a scroll entitled "Voyage Through the Land of Dreams", some nesting cylinders that have proverbs and paradoxes written on them, a dragon skull that has a plaque that reads "So Too Shall Ye Be" (ominous!), and a metal wheel with holy symbols on it. There are also some potions we can't identify, a pretty ring, a book of puzzles, and a golden sword hilt. No blade, just a hilt. </p>



<p>What to do with the hoard? Well, we can't let it go to waste, can we? Actaeon summoned Azorius's Keledone, and the Keledone took care of collecting the materials and storing them for us. Father wanted to speak with the cyclopes and I was going to go with him, so we left Telavasir's egg with Briar. Our party split up for a short while. Here's what happened with Shadow and I.</p>



<p>Father rode on Jungle Princess while I flew behind him, and he started looking for animal tracks. To his surprise, he found none. There is absolutely no other animal life on this island, apparently! We approached some of the cyclops shepherds and tried making some simple small talk with them. They are simple folk, very nearly peaceful. We learned that Helios was charged by the Lord of Storms - whom the cyclopes worship as their creator - to prepare the cyclopes for war. He was meant to train them in weaponry, help forge armors for them, and make them available once the call to war came upon the Emerald Isles. </p>



<p>Much to our surprise, it seems that Helios apparently began to care for the cyclopes. Whether it be pity or sincere concern for their wellbeing, it matters not. What matters is that they trusted Helios, and they became dinosaur shepherds for him. The cyclopes evidently did not like learning how to fight, but they all seem aware that they must obey the call from Amalj'aa, whenever that call comes to them. Shadow and I asked ourselves, was it worth it to try to convince them that the Twin Titans were not their true creators, and that they should not go to war?</p>



<p>I tried a thing. I excused myself, saying that I was going to return to the temple and send Helios himself to talk to the cyclopes while I went back with my friends. I made my way to the forest's edge and transformed into Helios, adorning myself in my finest clothing and carrying the staff of the golden heart. My guise was this: Helios (I) would be going on an adventure with the Dragonlords! They taught Helios that something about the gods' commands was wrong and I would take it upon myself to see what was happening. I, pretending to be Helios, told the cyclopes that <em>under no circumstances should they go to war without me</em>. I couldn't convince them to not go to war at all, though. When the League of Storms arrives someday in the future, they were going to call the cyclopes to fight, and there was nothing I or Helios could say to stop that. But perhaps if I convinced the cyclopes to remain on the Garden of Helios until I came with them, maybe that would delay them enough to save their lives?</p>



<p>As Shadow and I walked away from the shepherds, we discussed the war. It's going to be bad, Heath. People, innocent people, are going to die, all because Amalj'aa has delusions of grandeur and wants to set himself up to be a god of all of Xerender. The mortals and the fey of the Emerald Isles are just pawns to him, pieces in a game he wants to win, easily sacrificed to make his moves, and everyone will suffer. </p>



<p>I finally understand the League of Storms. After all this time, I get it. They're mortals. They want to get on his good side so they'll survive. They think he's going to win, so they've cast their lots into his pool. I remember the soldier, that nameless man, who survived when the oread lost control of her fire elemental and killed those people on the mountainside. Where is this man now? Is he still with the League of Storms? Will we come to blows next time we meet?</p>



<p>It's starting to weigh on me. War is coming. I can already hear the drums and I can already smell the smoke. We've only twenty two days remaining before everything comes crashing down around us. But I'm going to save as many lives as I can, friends and enemies alike. If it is in my power, I'll save whoever is there.</p>



<p>Holy WOW, something happened after this! Father and I met up with the others. They found something else amid the treasure of Helios. It was a ridiculously bright and gaudy chariot, covered in gold that shone brightly in the sunlight. Apparently only Notus, - who had now left our group to find his own way - knew of the stories of Helios. The golden sungod would fly across the sky in this chariot! And me, being how I just convinced the cyclopes that I was Helios, decided that I would give the chariot a shot. </p>



<p>Much to everyones' surprise, it came to life when I uttered the command word - Solis. Four horses, sights unseen here in the Emerald Isles, sprang into existence and took me high into the sky. I clung desperately to the sides of the chariot as we lifted off, the chariot pulled at high speeds behind the golden horses. But I gained control and, perhaps in a fit of chaos, started laughing. Oh, what joy and fun this was! I could see across the entire island, and I could see the Gjallarhorn quietly moored in the bay below me. Everything is so fun up here!</p>



<p>I accidentally threw a fireball at my friends. They didn't burn, you see. I can control that easily enough. But... I did it anyway. Part of me was mortified at what they're going to think when I land, and the other part of me wasn't caring. What a thrill!</p>



<p>I pulled the reins and landed the chariot on the ground. With a word, the chariot was deactivated and the horses disappeared. The chariot sat silent, waiting for a new rider, and I relinquished control of it to someone else. Perhaps it was best if I didn't have control over the chariot, I mused. Animals aren't my thing, and I have a child to take care of now - even though Telavasir hasn't even hatched yet. Control of the chariot instead went to Shadow. Father thought he could more easily control the magical horses, so he put himself to the test. To literally <em>no one's surprise</em>, he's fantastic at it! We made a plan, then. Shadow would control the chariot, and I would ride it behind him, backing Father up with whatever magic I could. From the skies, we would rain down destruction over our enemies! Well, he will. I'll just try to protect him.</p>



<p>The sun is still high in the sky when we left the Garden of Helios. We acquired a lot of treasure, though we hadn't intended on it. I have Telavasir's egg with me now, and things are looking up for us. Though our time remaining before the Oath of Peace ends is diminishing, we're getting better and better prepared for it. We're off to the Island of the Exiles now. There is one more instrument of Palladia there, the last that we need to complete the collection. After that, we start our war preparations. </p>



<p>It's going to be awkward, isn't it? Like... Helios was <em>just here</em>. And he broke his Oath of Guest Friendship, and the furies took him away. He's now on the Island of the Exiles. We're going there. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Us: "Hello, Helios! Long time no see!"<br>Helios: "Hello, again! It's been almost two days! How are you doing?"<br>Us: "Quite well, thank you."<br>Helios: "Sorry about that whole bit on eating you. I really shouldn't have done that."<br>Some nearby fury: "Yeah, probably not."<br>Us: "No worries, we're all fine now. Plus, we stole all your stuff."<br>Helios: "You what?"<br>Us: "Yeah, we took everything in your dragon hoard. It's ours now."<br>Helios: "..."<br>Us: "What?"</p>

<p><em>8 to Verdant Sun, Goloris, 20 days remaining</em></p>



<p>IT HAPPENED, HEATH!</p>



<p>OH MY GODS IT HAPPENED!</p>



<p>Yesterday, Briar helped me get set up with the dragon egg incubator. We got Telavasir's egg in there and I put some holy magic into it because that was what was going to work. I put everything I had into it. Today, I did the same. That must have been enough because the egg hatched. </p>



<p>Hatched is a weird word here. More like <em>exploded. </em>Shards of red and white sunstone went flying in all directions. The dragon inside was glowing brightly before the light dimmed and I could see her. Telavasir is incredibly pretty! She's a long, golden-scaled dragon with sunstone scales lining her spine. I've never seen one such as her before. She has no wings, and yet, she can fly just the same. She stretched and yawned, almost cat-like, before she wrapped herself around my neck. </p>



<p>There's no need for us to introduce ourselves. I know her name and she knows mine. In fact, she knows all the monikers I've used. My friends call me Leef or Flee, but she calls me Peaches. I'm not sure why, but I love the name. I think it's because she likes sweet things and thinks I'm sweet. At least, I hope that's the case. And I call her Tel since she insisted her own name has too many syllables. We both have short names, and we like it! I think we're going to be best of friends!</p>



<p>I took Tel to meet everyone on the ship, and she's incredibly excited to see everyone. She seems fascinated with the other dragon wyrmlings since they have to flap wings to fly and she can just do it on her own without effort. Tel likes sweets, Briar quickly surmised as Tel buried herself in a jar of candies Briar had just recently made. Since she's my ward now, I have to take responsibility for her nutrition. As a newly hatched baby dragon, she needs nutrients and even I have to admit that Briar's peppermint candies don't provide very many vitamins and minerals. So when I introduced Shadow and Ysgramor to Tel, Shadow served up some fish and I flavored it to taste ultra-sweet. That seemed to do the trick.</p>



<p>Oh, she's so pretty, Heath. You would have adored her! She's incredibly sweet, and I love her dearly. I love them all, really. Malkarion, Dromoka, Ysgramor, and Zirconis are all so silly and fun. I only just met Leusinia and Telavasir, but I know they'll fit in really well. But the question remains for us now, what about Rendu? He's a dragonlord, too. We've no knowledge of other dragon eggs anywhere. What will happen for him? And what happened to Sevatarian, Actaeon's original dragon?</p>



<p>We're going to be arriving at the Island of the Exiles very soon. I'm curious what's going to happen with us and Helios. Will he fight us again? It would be such a grave mistake for him to do so. Perhaps he will be more amiable now, though. The others say that if he can negotiate an Oath of Service with any of us, he may leave the island. Are there other oathbreakers that would want to do that as well? I think we best be on our guard, then. Who knows what awaits us there?</p>
