<p><em>2 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 25 days remaining</em></p>



<p>“Stay. One step closer and I’ll end it,” said the hieracosphinx.</p>



<p>Shadow replied, "Elaborate."</p>



<p>"Your existence."</p>



<p>It was quite the threat, one that shook us a bit. But unfortunately for the hieracosphinx, we were not shaken enough to turn back. Our quest was too important. Besides, Clio was bonded to the dragon just past these metal doors. We had work to do.</p>



<p>I asked for its name, but the hieracosphinx refused to give it to me. Father asked what it was doing here, and it replied that it was meant to guard the vault. Briar asked if we could speak with its superior, but the creature was resolute. It would not let us pass, and it would attack if we made any moves on it. We tried a lot of ideas for reasoning with it. Could if accompany us to make sure we didn't do anything harmful? Since Torag and Rendu are demigods, children of the gods of our world, could they come in? Could the hieracosphinx bring something from the vault out to us instead of us going in? Could we offer it something in sacrifice in exchange for what lies beyond the door? Can we trade treasure for treasure? Even Torag asked us, "Do you think I could just make a run for it?" Gods, you should have seen the look of fury on Briar's face. She hissed back, "Don't you <em>dare</em> do something so reckless!"</p>



<p>We were stymied in all our efforts. The hieracosphinx was firm. Under no circumstances would it allow us to pass.  We had already kind of figured this based on the first words the creature had said, but we got a confirmation of it in the strangest way. Actaeon pulled out Titansbane, the sword he had, and asked it, "What do you think, sword?" We all thought Actaeon had totally lost his mind - the war 500 years ago, losing his memories, losing his friends - but... no that was not the case. Rather, Titansbane has a spirit inside it. I think? I don't know how to describe it. But the sword speaks to him sometimes. Maybe we'll come back to that one later sometime.</p>



<p>As resolute as the hieracosphinx was, we were firm in our stance as well. Torag said to him, "We stand against the evil of the twin titans. We will slay the gods themselves, and you're in the way. You're just practice."</p>



<p>Clio had meant to run to the doors, and she aimed to do it by transpositioning herself and the hieracosphinx. Those are her words, and I had to ask her to clarify. It meant she would teleport the sphinx to <em>us</em> while she teleported to its place and ran to the door. We drew weapons and got ready. But as soon as she cast the spell, the world evaporated around us. A split appeared on the ground, and a black and red energy swept over the area. We were falling, seemingly endlessly. Gods, it felt like an eternity of just falling through the air. We panicked, but the fall kept happening, and we all got a chance to think - how will we fight this creature once this ends, if ever?</p>



<p>I think I blacked out temporarily. I was on a cliffside, looking down at a battlefield where Clio was fighting against the hieracosphinx. She teleported herself to safety as a strange mote of green energy pulsed nearby. The sphinx raked across Clio with its claws, but she was able to mitigate the damage with her shielding ability. Shadow appeared nearby to back her up, covering her escape by firing arrows into the creature. But it was strange! The creature was shielded by something around it, and Shadow said that when he fired an arrow at it, magic energy rebounded on him and injured him as well. </p>



<p>Gathering my courage, I jumped off the cliff and landed on Razorclaw - after calling him out of the gemstone to aid me - and I sped to catch up to the others. Briar and Rendu fired magic from a hillside, and Actaeon and Torag charged forward. The dragons with us stayed back to blast the creature with their breath weapons - except Malkarion, who bravely charged into the fray with Actaeon.</p>



<p>Within moments, the creature was gravely injured, its blood spilling onto the stone beneath it. We had taken damage, too, from the rebound magic, but we were strong. This creature was nothing to us, the Heroes of Prophesy, the Knights of Xavian, the Dragonlords!</p>



<p>Then... it reversed time. The mote of green energy burst, and everything went in reverse for a moment. We all got a little seasick when it did. Clio found herself teleported <em>back</em> to the hieracosphinx, and the hieracosphinx had healed up all of its injuries. It was as it the attacks we sent at it had never even happened! Stupid Island of Time nonsense...</p>



<p>The hieracosphinx threw attacks at us, clawing at whoever was close, and throwing magical stars at the rest. I got bruised pretty bad, and it affected my ability to cast. I tried dispelling the creature's magical barrier, but it didn't work. I was too dizzy! I pulled out my want to blast it, but the time reversal thing made my shot miss. I never miss with that spell! Ugh!</p>



<p>The sphinx called out an echo, a manifestation of itself, to harass us while it defended against Actaeon and Torag. Rendu dealt with the echo pretty quick, though. The barrier around the sphinx made it nearly impossible to damage it without hurting yourself. At one point, Torag jumped <em>onto</em> the barrier, hoping we could dispel it. </p>



<p>The worst thing happened, though. The hieracosphinx made some more motes of time magic. It was going to reverse time and heal itself again! Actaeon had rushed in with his axe and spears to try to stop it before time could reverse. But the hieracosphinx saw it coming somehow. It grappled Actaeon in its weird freaky beak and threw him off the cliff. And in an instant, he was gone!</p>



<p>We raged as we saw him fall to his death. Clio decided to teleport Torag <em>inside</em> the hieracosphinx's barrier, and when he got there, he wailed a battle cry. His sword, the War God's Triumph, erupted into black flames and he stabbed down at the sphinx. It didn't see the attack coming. Its body was consumed in the black fire and it cried out in pain. As it did, the ethereal plane we were on vanished and we were instantly back in front of the metal doors that blocked the vault. </p>



<p>Thank the gods Actaeon was with us when we reappeared here. It turns out, he held on by falling on the underbelly of the barrier around the hieracosphinx. The creature didn't even realize its own protective barrier was protecting us to a degree. I'm glad that was the case. I ran and hugged him when we realized he wasn't dead!</p>



<p>The hieracosphinx was blocking the door still, but it was different this time. It was defeated, exhausted, damaged. Its blood spilled onto the rocks and it was breathing heavily. It whispered "We shall meet again," before its body crumbled to ash and dust and blew away.</p>



<p>Torag snorted. "Just practice."</p>



<p>The draw Clio felt to the inside of the vault was strong, and she yearned to get inside. I cast a spell of magical detection and saw that the door itself was just a big metal door. Torag helped me push it open and we found a world that almost seemed to materialize into existence when we looked inside. It was full of stars, stars as endless as the ocean!</p>



<p>My magical eyes caught a few interesting things, and I told my friends about them. Father got a quiver with a set of magical arrows. I found a large dragon scale that had some strange chipping on it. Actaeon and Father both said it was being used as a whetstone. Clio might want to take a look at it and study it a bit.</p>



<p>Speaking of Clio, she's... she's <em>whole</em> now! There's a noticeable change in her now that she has her dragon egg. The egg itself is beautiful! Unlike the metallic eggs, this one looks like a strange, opalescent gemstone. Hmmm, perhaps I shouldn't use the word <em>strange</em>. Otherworldly seems appropriate, and it really fits with Clio's history as a kind-of sort-of reincarnation of Eos. Clio ran and hugged the egg when she saw it, and she smiled brightly when she looked at its beautiful shell. I haven't seen her smile like this in a while! She sensed the dragon inside, waiting to meet her. The dragon's name is Leusinia. I wonder what kind of dragon she will be?</p>



<p>The last thing we found in the room was my destiny. A large tome, pearl white, warm to the touch, was in front of me. I knew it as the Book of Life, even before I dared open it. My mind raced as I did, remembering the madness of Enigma when he looked inside. But I found myself seemingly fine. The words were a jumble of symbols in a language I couldn't read. I panicked briefly. How was I supposed to save the Emerald Isles if I can't even read the book?</p>



<p>My anxiety wore off, though. The ink on the pages moves slightly, and the symbols rearranged themselves into draconic runes, my native language. I couldn't spare more time than a simple cursory glance at the book, but it confirmed all we learned from Vanadon-Necroth. There are paragraphs and full pages of the history of the Emerald Isles and its separation from Xerender. The book details the lust of Amalj'aa and his penchant for conquering Xerender after he has left the Emerald Isles ruined under his thumb. And the book confirmed the ire of the elder gods of Xerender - when the veil between worlds is thinnest, they will invade and take their revenge upon U'atu The Hundred-Handed for his crimes, and that invasion will utterly destroy the Emerald Isles. There will be no hope for the people here. Every single person, animal, fowl, and fish will perish - for that is how great are the crimes of The Hundred-Handed, and how great is the fury of the elder gods of Xerender. </p>



<p>I've so much to study in this book. I've so much to learn. I must save these people.</p>



<p>It took us a moment to decide where to go next. Clio and I found what we needed here - Leusinia's egg and the Book of Life are with the Dragonlords now. What reason do we have to stay on the Island of Time? But Actaeon is frustrated. Luis Dante is still stuck at the stone table. Actaeon wants to rescue him. If it's important to him, its important to the rest of us as a group. We're off to the next location - the lookout - and hopefully we'll find some way to save Dante. He was a good dragonlord, according to Actaeon. His fate should be kinder. </p>



<p>I think I'll read some more of the Book of Life on the way there, though. Its like a good novel, you know? I can't put it down. Not that its enchanted to make me want to read it. I just like history books. Also, you know, there's the whole "Leef you have to learn from this book or everyone will die" thing. No pressure, right?</p>
