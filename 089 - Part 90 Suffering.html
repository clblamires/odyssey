<p><em>8 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 31 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Torag was gone now, having taken his mother Ophea back to the Gjallarhorn. Vaevictus went with them, as did Sel-Makor and Ilharg. I should think those two probably won’t want to come with us on adventures again for a while now. Sel-Makor found himself quite frustrated at fighting the golems. He never got to strike the dragon, and that was something he looked forward to doing. Ilharg just keeps saying his head is ringing, the poor guy!</p>



<p>The rest of us split up the affairs of dealing with the aftermath. Rendu, Actaeon, and I went searching for Jadaferlas’s hoard of treasures. Shadow was hellbent on finding Moxena and Clio offered to help. Briar and Kano got to the grisly work of… <em>acquiring important magical ‘parts’</em>... from Jadaferlas’s slain body. Gods, I hate it when they do that. I mean, sure, I realize that it is necessary and much of our gear is crafted from dragon harvests. It’s just so icky, though!</p>



<p>Shadow and Clio sought Moxena, to finally bring that wretch to justice. She could not be found, though, as she had sort of faded into the shadows and shade of the trees and earth here. But last Shadow remembered, he saw her form disappear into a cave at the back end of the glade. So down they went, following along a path in the dark until they came to the treasure hoard. </p>



<p>Which was perfect because Rendu, Actaeon, and I met up with them as they went in. My group was on duty to figure out what to do with all the treasure in there and see what would be important to use and take. Apart from a ridiculous amount of gold and silver and platinum, we found some interesting trinkets. I ended up pocketing some dragon-shaped combs as well as a velvet mask - an important part of the mask I’ll be making for Shadow. </p>



<p>There was also this strange bronze crown. Nothing magical about it (Rendu checked), but I was drawn to it. It kind of looked like the little crown from the storybooks we read when we were children, Heath. Do you remember the stories about the warrior queen who fought against… goodness, I forget what exactly. But I remembered it in the moment and decided I wanted that crown. </p>



<p>Why did I want the crown? Well, that’s a question my companions asked, too. Truth be told, I just wanted it because it looked nice. I made up some story about wanting to become the queen or king of some city like Ellandyr, and Father began scolding me about not knowing enough about politics - and that is certainly true. Clio brought up the idea that I couldn’t be a ruler of Ellandyr because then I’d have to be Aminatou’s consort, and she’s much too intimidating for me to get along with like that. Maybe if we got to know each other better, but for now I think it’s safe to say I’ve no romantic interest in Aminatou. But I'm still interested in having the crown. It’s lovely to look at! Father made me give it to Actaeon, though.</p>



<p>Oh, right, Father and Clio kept searching in the cave until they found some statues that were too reminiscent of the missing bards from Ellandyr. It seems Moxena had been sending these poor souls to Jadaferlas for a long time. A wicked act, truly. One such statue was being used to trigger a trapdoor in the floor. When Father and Clio found it (with Malkarion’s help to trigger its mechanism), we all stared down into a pit that led beneath the mountain, all the way down to an underground lake. </p>



<p>Shadow and Clio went down, and Actaeon sent Malkarion to accompany them. Ysgramor, Shadow said, was to stay with me. I’d like to believe that Father trust’s me to watch over the young dragon, but I’m also well aware that Shadow - amongst others - seems to think that I can get into some shenanigans when I am unsupervised. They’re not wrong, per se. I’m very trustworthy and capable, but I think my youth precludes my experience. </p>



<p>They were gone for a long time. It started worrying Actaeon, so he hooked up a long rope and started climbing down after them. Ysgramor and I joined since we can fly. We took extra care to make sure Actaeon was safe. When we got to the bottom of this pit, we realized that it opened up to an expansive underground lake. Using our sending stones, Actaeon send a message to Clio to see what was going on. Clio and Shadow and Malkarion thought they were hot on the trail after Moxena. They had found a destroyed amazonian ship with petrified amazonesses - almost a certain sign that Moxena had been through here. Actaeon, Ysgramor, and I began the pursuit, too.</p>



<p>Actaeon swam while Ysgramor and I flew, following after Shadow, Clio, and Malkarion. We passed the wrecked amazonian ship and eventually made our way out of the cave with the underground lake. We found ourselves on the western shore of the Island of the Dragon now, far from the Gjallarhorn. </p>



<p>I thought about contacting Moxena at this point. Trying to see if I can convince her to surrender and join us. Even as a prisoner, she might be useful. Unfortunately, Ysgramor is a little <em>snitch</em> and wouldn’t keep a secret for me. Father would be very cross if I gave Moxena one last chance to make the right decision. I couldn’t contact her without Ysgramor hearing, and he refused to keep my contact a secret. So there goes that plan.</p>



<p>Outside the cave, Clio was the beach, resting and drying in the sun. Malkarion was helping Shadow by flying overhead, searching for medusas or boats that a medusa would be helming. Meanwhile Shadow himself was in the shallows, trying desperately to find an animal so he could cast a spell and have it search the water for him. Clio suggested that since we were on the wrong side of the island and climbing back <em>up</em> the hole in the cave would be nearly impossible at this point, it would be best if the Gjallarhorn came to pick us up instead of us going to where it is moored. Ysgramor was sent back to Briar with the bell we use to summon Azorius’s Keledone (that way Briar, Rendu, and Kano can have Keledone deal with the… parts… they salvaged from Jadaferlas’s corpse). They would go back to the Gjallarhorn and meet up with Torag and the others, then sail over to this side and pick us up.</p>



<p>It would be a few hours before the Gjallarhorn would come pick us up. We tried entertaining each other, but there wasn’t much to do. The elves on the island never reappeared, and I suspect they were marching up to Jadaferlas’s glade all day long. We caught some fish and picked some fruits and relaxed on the beach. I have a nice tan now, as do the others. Shadow never did find a dolphin, although Briar and Torag played a little trick on him by having Briar turn into a dolphin. We all heard Torag shout “SHADOW GET ON THE DOLPHIN!”, which Shadow did, of course. But I never would have thought that Shadow would look so dejected and discouraged while riding on a dolphin. And to Briar’s credit, it looked very fun.</p>



<p>Clio used a scry spell to find Moxena. She’d already gotten a spare boat from the beach here and was in the ocean somewhere now. We could chase her, but what’s the point? We have work to do, so we will just let her float away for now.</p>



<p>It’s been a day. Ophea has joined the crew, and Vaevictus looks so happy. Torag seems uneasy, though. He finished something he had vowed to do years ago, and now that the work is over, he seems… tired? Torag took a lot of injuries today. But the dragon is dead, and the world is better for it. </p>

<p><em>7 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 30 days remaining</em></p>



<p>It’s a new day of sailing, and we’re aiming for the Maw of Havarl. There’s a lot to do there, and we need to start getting prepared. First, I prayed with my scriptures for a bit and started trying to memorize some new spells. There’s a few listed in there that I’ve never tried before. They’re kind of neat. Ysgramor came to help me with something today, too. We’re going to make something for Father, so we had to spend a lot of time in the library trying to figure out how to get it done. I think he’ll really like it. </p>



<p>We also looked into the Maw of Havarl. It’s a mighty volcano seemingly in the middle of the sea. All the stories of the Maw are terrible. People who land on the island perish, or go crazy, or something else happens. Every story of the Maw has a horrific end. Why is the Maw of Havarl important? We wouldn’t go there unless it was necessary. And it is, because this is the path to clearing Briar’s curse. </p>



<p>Briar is nervous. Maybe even scared? We did some divination today, she and I. She must go alone. Actaeon had expressed interest in joining her to help keep her protected, but whatever magic is there will not help him. Only her. Even Zirconis is unable to accompany her. It has something to do with her curse. I wish Versi were here so we could get some insight on that, but we have to save our spells and make sure things are okay here. </p>



<p>Something awful happened today. Clio scried on Moxena again. That woman is about to go through endless suffering. She went to the Nether Sea. She’s going to Khar’shan! Desperation is a drug. I tried contacting her several times, but Moxena refused to answer. I confessed to my friends how you had died, Heath, by the hands of thieves. I still think anyone can be redeemed, and I’ll stick to that tenet of my faith. But even my faith has its limits. I’m afraid that Moxena must surely die now. We will eventually sail into the Nether Sea, too, and Moxena will receive no mercy from me. What a shame! She could have been so much more.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><em>5 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 28 days remaining</em></p>



<p>We approached the Maw early this morning. The sea grew rough as we approached the massive volcanic island with black smoke blowing freely into the sky and darkening the sun. If this were a leisure trip, we would take in the sights of the island - a beauty in its own right - and we would depart after saying things like “Oh, my, what a pretty island” and “Look how… something something… geology.” I don’t know anything about rocks, but just… I don’t know… Imagine I said something very insightful about rocks and volcanoes and stuff. </p>



<p>Briar is shaking, but she’s trying very hard to not show it. She knows she has to do this alone. Zirconis has not left her side all morning, and the rest of us feel the nerves. Clio and I cast a variety of spells on her, doing everything we can to keep her protected. Briar let me put a platinum ring on her, one that causes the both of us to share pain. It’ll give her a modicum of protection, and my friends on the ship will keep me magically healed so I don’t pass out. With a great big group hug, we saw her off. She flapped her beautiful wings and flew through the ash and smog towards the volcano.</p>



<p>Oh, imagine how free she will feel once her curse is gone! Without that constant itch on her spine, she’ll be free to make her own destiny, without having to deal with Khar’shan’s pettiness. I can’t wait to see how excited and happy she’ll be. </p>



<p>Briar will write this next part. It is better that it comes from her perspective.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>So, uh… hello, Heath? Or just Leef’s journal? They asked me to write about my experiences since I was alone in the volcano. I guess they like to write down our adventures and experiences and all that. Maybe similar to my letters to Herkus, which I am now realizing I haven’t written in several days now and so much has happened. </p>



<p>Anyway, they all gave me some items and used some spells on me to help me with this. I didn’t know at the time when I was headed toward the volcano but Malkarion was following me. It was probably good that he did, but more on that later. </p>



<p>Over the volcano I heard voices offering me power and riches. I had sort of expected it but it was still a bit unnerving. None of those things interest me. Not because I’m altruistic or anything, but more I know they wouldn’t change things for me. Then a second voice said “What are you doing here? All alone, all alone… You dream about ending it. But what price will you pay?”</p>



<p>I don’t know how much Leef has written about my circle or druid things in general, but mine is the circle of sacrifice. There is a push and pull to sacrifice often seems like a straightforward transaction, but is in fact much more complicated. When I prepare something for sacrifice there is an emotional kickback that is almost necessary for it to have meaning. I might not be explaining this well and Leef only has so many pages here, sorry. Essentially, a real sacrifice is something you hold precious. It is filled with longing and joy, sorrow, ferocity or even regret. It is something you protect. It can be an overwhelming feeling. When a battle is done and I use my circle to aid my allies, I am giving up the hope I had for that individual. I am giving up the sum of their being for someone else to thrive and be happy. Other sacrifices that land on specific days require time and preparation, such as an animal dedicated to Eos. I take the time to know and love that beast before exchanging their life because otherwise it is just a beast. Other than their pulse are you really sacrificing anything of yourself with it? Anyway, it gets a big grey and complicated but my head hurts and maybe someday I can have a deep philosophical debate with Leef’s journal but not right now. I would cross all that out and start over but I can picture the horror on Leef’s face if I used up their parchment that way. So I knew going in whatever it would require of me to get rid of my curse would be big. The scales need to be as balanced as possible. </p>



<p>Oh yeah, by the way, I’m cursed. I don’t know if Leef has written that before. I also promised not to read anything else written so I can’t double check. </p>



<p>This grand room that I entered was bleak and colorless. Although I doubt the underworld was ever meant to be an inviting place, coming into a place that is made of bone and sinew and blood is a bit… disturbing? Very similar to Khar’shan’s temple, what with all the hopelessness and such. When I move past the fog of the room there is a voice that commands me to come forward. The source being a beast not even Shadow could love. A hellish nightmare of a creature with three horned heads. </p>



<p>It points out that while my shape has changed the mark remains, and long has it waited for me to come. It says, “Five hundred years. That is how long I’ve been made to watch, to punish. Today you decide. Do I continue? Or does it end?” Then I see my two ancestors appear from a sigil. They are thin, and ghastly, and their mouths are sewn shut. Their state is horrific. The beast then explains to me that they have been punished these 500 years for betraying their makers. I tried to refute that because not only do my beliefs in Eos say otherwise, but Clio has told me this is not the case with the titans. And if anyone would know she would. She’s incredibly knowledgeable about this stuff AND she was literally born from the tree of Eos. That holds much more weight and authority for me. But the beast believes differently. </p>



<p>He goes on to point out that they are the reason for my suffering. I nearly wanted to laugh. As if I didn’t know that. As if I was not keenly aware that I was living the consequences of the choice they made. But Herkus once told me that there is a thin line between blame and accountability. “Blame focuses on assigning fault for adverse events, with no opportunity for growth or learning from one's mistakes. Accountability replaces finger-pointing and defensiveness and instead seeks to solve the problem at its root cause.” </p>



<p>Although I had a feeling I needed to ask, “How do I break my curse?”</p>



<p>I was told then, that I could kill them one in front of the other as this creature Cerberus had for 500 years. </p>



<p>There was a bit more back and forth but honestly it’s hazy. Maybe I’ll remember and tell the rest to Leef later. As of now suffice it to say that if I killed them, my curse would end. Their lives would end, but their souls would continue to suffer. This being, the cerberus, had no control and was living for its purpose to serve Khar’shan. My other ancestors would not be tormented as these two because they had already paid for it in life and death. But then it said something to the effect of “I do as I am bidden. As you are now bidden.” </p>



<p>With that in mind, I did something that was not well thought out. I was emotional, (not a rarity for me but also not my best feature) and I decided then and there that I would not give in to Khar’shan’s rules and assignments. But I also didn’t want to just walk away. </p>



<p>I am not so arrogant as to say I am the strongest of the dragon lords. Far from it. But I try to make up with my shortcomings with spells and summons to assist me, so that I may better assist others. But actual fighting? At the end of the day I am a healer and a cook. I like this role. It’s cozy and makes me feel at peace like when I was with Herkus. (Oh by the way, Leef’s Journal, that is my adoptive father. Too much backstory sorry.)</p>



<p>Knowing this I challenged this creature. In part due to my anger and frustration that it was still Khar’shan setting up the game and the rules but also out of pity that this was the creature that would inflict such torment on my ancestors. I could not save them but maybe I could lessen their anguish for a time. </p>



<p>My first spell didn’t land. It was something stronger than me and it failed. It was from a scroll that was gifted to me. It would have called three minotaur skeletons to aid me. The beast knocked me down and deafened me. Actually, that is putting it far too mildly. A geyser of blood spewed out of the moat pond thing and knocked me down, and then the beast roared so loud I couldn’t hear anything.  I was covered in that awful blood from the moat. It gave me flashbacks to Rendu in the pool of blood at Khar’shan’s gross temple. Did Leef ever mention that? Anyway… It was disgusting. Untethered souls were around me and I wanted to throw up. It was so vile. But I did my best to rally. </p>



<p>My next spell worked. I have never used this one before but I was able to summon a spectral dragon. It was beautiful and fearsome. I can picture Zirconis when he is grown being just as majestic. After it fights on my side as much as it could, darkness enveloped both of them and I couldn’t see what was happening. I set down spikes in front of me to hopefully slow it down if it came at me. It did some but not enough. If it hadn’t been for Leef and Clio, I would not be writing this. It was them, a very large potion of healing and my mistletoe that kept me alive. I flew up in the air and I felt stupid that I hadn’t before, but I had been worried that if it roared again I would fall and that might kill me. Then I had a moment of clarity like someone unknown entity reminding me that I was already deaf so that was unlikely to happen. So up and up I went. </p>



<p>There is nothing pleasant about Khar’shan or things of her making and domain and this creature was no different. It spewed acid at me but I was able to bring lightning down on its head as well. It was a back and forth of it trying to bite me or shoot me with acid, and me trying to bring as much pain via lightning as I could manage. </p>



<p>And somehow, I won. Though it was only a glimpse of a reprieve for my ancestors torment, and though I was hurting in all possible ways, I somehow survived. </p>



<p>Afterwards was a conversation with my ancestors that I would rather not rehash here. I told Leef and Clio about plenty of it so if Leef wishes to include it I don’t mind. It’s still just too raw for me. </p>



<p>I woke up to Malkarion poking me to get me to consciousness. He said we needed to leave now because bad things were happening. So I guess I’m glad he was there. Who knows how long I would have been passed out otherwise? </p>



<p>I wish I could say the power of love and friendship conquered all here but it did not. I’m still cursed. But I will say, it brings me comfort nonetheless. </p>



<p>So, um… yeah I guess that’s about it.  </p>

<p>I’ll write more tomorrow. I can’t leave Briar right now.</p>
