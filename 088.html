<p><em>9 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 32 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Sailing the Forgotten Sea has been terrifying, but also kind of... pleasant? The sea here, so far from the rest of the Emerald Isles, feels more open. And for that, it feels more frightening. All of us have been finding ourselves on the top deck more often than usual, scanning the horizons for threats. The weather has been fair but it feels more gloomy out here.</p>



<p>Azorius's Keledone returned today with some gifts from the Mithral Forge. Actaeon's new spear is ready, and it looks gorgeous! For an instrument of war, I mean. Actaeon and I are good friends, obviously, and I'd never cross him for many reasons. But if we ever ended up on the opposite side of a battle, I will absolutely, unequivocally surrender to him immediately. That's a fearsome weapon.</p>



<p>Torag received his weapon today, too! It is called the War God's Triumph, modeled after a sword that Vaevictus was to wield during the wars before the Oath of Peace. As the story goes, Azorius never finished it before the Oath came to pass. With the materials collected over our time together, Torag finally had everything ready to have the weapon crafted. It is beautiful and terrible to behold, and it radiates with a soft blackish glow. And Torag is <em>all smiles</em> right now.</p>



<p>The day was uneventful, apart from meeting in the navigation room to discuss our next stop. Tomorrow we will reach the Island of the Dragon, so we had to discuss how that would go. Actaeon, as it turns out, was acquainted with Jadaferlas before the Oath of Peace. I don't know how they know each other, but all Actaeon would say is that she's a crafty dragon and is very angry. Being a green dragon, she can breathe poisonous fumes and her teeth are venomous. She was once a consort of Vaevictus years ago. How long ago? Actaeon didn't even know that. Torag says that he met her only once, when she swooped down from the sky and roared. He was a child at the time, and he ran to his mom for safety. But his mother was taken by Jadaferlas, grasped between her claws, and dragged away into the sky, never to be seen again. </p>



<p>Honestly, we're all sometimes surprised by how well Torag copes with this. He's been through a lot. Watching his mother get kidnapped by a dragon, being cursed and turning into a minotaur, and being around his perpetually drunk father all the time. I might give Torag a hug later. I might give everyone a hug later, come to think of it.</p>



<p>I started working on that mask for Father. He wants something fearsome, so I had to mix some new dyes. I have a lot of feathers from the Tortles and I've plenty of twine. Looking through some books in the library and having a nice chat with Sokrates, I found some designs that I like. They resemble fearsome animals. Will Shadow be offended if I alter the mask like that? I don't think of him as an animal, obviously. </p>



<p>But I bet he was cute as a baby.</p>

<p><em>8 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 31 days remaining</em></p>



<p>We dropped our anchor off the shore of the Island of the Green dragon in the early hours, just as I was finishing my prayers. The island is beautiful. It's a crescent shape that is almost entirely covered in thick trees, and a fog is hanging over it. It looks like a tropical paradise. Pink sandy beaches, clear water cascading down falls, it's beautiful! There are some mountains towards the center, and we think Jadaferlas might be up there. Actaeon can sense draconic presences and seemed to agree. The presence of a dragon is the only thing marring the picturesque view.</p>



<p>Briar sent out a hawk to overlook the beaches while we approached on our rowboats. Ilharg rowed one boat with me, Clio, Briar, Shadow, and Kano. Actaeon rowed the other with Rendu, Torag, and Sel-Makor. The baby dragons flew just over our heads. Briar looked through her hawk and reported that she could only see vines and thorns in the ticket at the tree line. That was concerning. It was going to be difficult to get through. We tried fire, but it's going to take me and Briar ages to burn through it without spending a lot of our magical power.</p>



<p>Briar thought of this, as it turns out. She summoned a fire elemental creature and just had it <em>walk forward</em>. That was apparently all it had to do, and Briar and I just kind of controlled the extra flames to make sure we didn't burn down the entire jungle. We were getting through the thick vines and thorns fairly well now, but after about an hour or so, I saw something in the brush near us. </p>



<p>We drew weapons in an instant, but those in the jungle who were watching us kept their arms in the air, surrendering. They were elves and warriors, each dressed differently. There must have been twenty or more of them, easily outnumbering us. But again, their weapons were at their sides and their arms were raised in a pose of surrender. After a few moments of silence, Torag spoke simply: "Leave us. Our quarrel is with the green dragon, not you."</p>



<p>The elf closest to me, dressed in rags that resembled the clothing of Talys, sighed. Jadaferlas, it seems, does not idly let visitors reach her island. She asked us who we are, and we answered that we are the Dragonlords, the Knights of Xavian, and we were here to slay this dragon and fight against those that would oppress the Emerald Isles. The elves around us looked uneasy, with a few of them whispering that the Dragonlords had long since perished. When we displayed our dragonmarks, their eyes changed. One, wearing worn-out novarran robes, cried for joy. She said this might be a sign from the gods, that we were here to deliver them from the green dragon. </p>



<p>They gave us some information. Jadaferlas the Venomous is indeed high at the mountaintops, and she spread out the thick vines and thorns to trap her prisoners - the elves here - on the island forever. There are numerous tribes of elves and they've all taken to fighting against the Venomous over the years, but they never gained a single victory against her. Rather, the elves here have become her favored prey. But for food, they do not sate her. Instead, she takes great pleasure in their torture, sitting lavishly in her glade, surrounded by broken statues of beautiful maidens.</p>



<p>Our thoughts went immediately to the Lady of Coins, Moxena. She was turning people into statues and, we are sure of it now, shipping those statues to Jadaferlas. According to the elves, Jadaferlas would mock them and break them into pieces. Our thoughts then went to Torag's mother, taken from him when he was but a boy. Was she turned into a statue, too? Torag considered this and said, "This changes <em>nothing</em>."</p>



<p>As he said it, we heard a deafening roar coming from the direction of the Gjallarhorn. The sky darkened above us briefly as we saw the shape of a dragon fly overhead, <em>away</em> from the Gjallarhorn. Followed by a drunken cry. </p>



<p>Oh gods, she kidnapped Vaevictus. </p>



<p>"Oh gods, my father is an idiot," said Torag. </p>



<p>The elves asked if we wanted help slaying the dragon, but we were hesitant. We're the Dragonlords, and we've a lot of experience fighting dragons now. These elves have had nothing but torturous skirmishes with the Venomous for ages. Having them with us might be a death sentence for them. They knew that, though. The elves agreed to gather the tribes on the island and assail Jadaferlas's glade. We were going to go up there immediately. If things went amiss for us, the elves could back us up. Such was our plan. The elves departed now, and we pressed on, following the path that Briar's fire elemental created for us.</p>



<p>Hours passed before we came to the glade at the top of the mountains, and we heard Jadaferlas shouting at Vaevictus as we approached.</p>



<p>"How could I forgive you? How could I forget? You know it. This is your fault that I am trapped here."</p>



<p>Pristine water, shining and clear, came from a pool up above us where we saw a horrific sight. There was Jadaferlas, an enormous dragon with shining green scales, stood towering over the inert figure of Vaevictus, tied in the air by who thick metal chains. Around him were the remains of stone statues, faces of maidens, all facing towards him. Above him on a short cliff were two figures. One was a half-elven woman forcibly playing a small harp. Beside her was the hooded medusa, Moxena.</p>



<p>"And what? Will you not speak to me of vows? No, you could not honor your vows to me, those that you made on our wedding day!"</p>



<p>We beheld the heaps of gleaming gold and gemstones all around us, adding to the glittering scene. Torag recognized the tune the woman played, and he growled deeply.</p>



<p>"So I made this place a memorial to you and me. To our suffering. Gaze, God of Battle, upon your failure."</p>



<p>The stone faces were the many people that Vaevictus had loved over the years. Five hundred years of his consorts, all on display, their petrified faces and bodies gouged by the claws of the Venomous. And Vaevictus did not raise his head or regard Jadaferlas at all.</p>



<p>"Every nymph you dallied with, every athlete that caught your eye, every noblewoman and maid you bedded, each sycophant, every so-called 'love' that you flaunted for the world. You flaunted in front of <em>me</em>. Each of them are here. Look, Vaevictus, and see the hollowness in their eyes."</p>



<p>Tears streamed down the face of the woman with the harp. Moxena did not move. And Jadaferlas's voice cracked.</p>



<p>"But you, Vaevictus, you were <em>my</em> great love. My only love. Did you know that? Did you know that you were the only love for me? My life is tragedy, from the death of my mother at the hands of the Dragonlords to the time when the bitch Selesnya 'adopted' me. You brought me happiness. You were my light in the dark!"</p>



<p>Jadaferlas turned her head towards us now, her tail scattering the coins and gems around her. The woman with the harp cried out, startled. Moxena's eyes narrowed when she saw us now.</p>



<p>"God of Battle, you robbed me of <em>everything</em>. And now, another of your wicked little spawn has come to rob me of my life and my vengeance." She beheld Torag. "Oh yes, I know you. I know of you and why you're here, Son of Vaevictus. I am your destiny. I am your last great labor to overcome. As if I had not overcome my own sorrows, you were here to witness me as a wounded body in a playboy's torrid affairs."</p>



<p>Torag just grunted and drew out his sword. "Get over yourself."</p>



<p>Jadaferlas laughed mockingly. "All I've fought to overcome, all I've done after I was discarded. Fine. Let this be the end. The end of you, Son of Vaevictus, the end of me, and the end of the God of Battle. I care not. This is how it must be. Let it all crash down now."</p>



<p>And she launched herself at us.</p>
