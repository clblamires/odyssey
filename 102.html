<p><em>10 to Wakening Sun, Goloris</em>, <em>6 days remaining</em></p>



<p>We all agreed: it was time to leave. Whatever we were doing here, it is done. Khar’shan is on her way!</p>



<p>The prison cube rocked back and forth, vibrating with each slam by whatever creature was locked away inside it. We began to flee, running back up the passage ways we had come from, steadying each other as best as we could. Briar and I took to flying occasionally when the world seemed to tilt at the worst angles, only to have one of our friends accidentally smack into us. </p>



<p>As we were leaving, we heard shouting from one of the stone doors we had not inspected. We thought the person on the other side of the wall was terribly angry, but Torag corrected us. “I know that language. It’s not anger, but fear.” We asked him what the voice was saying.</p>



<p><em>“Why is the Primal Calamity awake?!”</em></p>



<p>Oh, no! That’s the worst possible scenario for waking up a primal beast! Had we known it was the Primal Calamity, we might have tried a different prison cube. But then again, we didn’t know where any where. What other choice did we have?</p>



<p>Torag stopped to listen further. “They’re talking about killing the Calamity. Something about annihilation. Some kind of magic object?”</p>



<p>Annihilation? That sounded familiar, but only vaguely. We decided to just keep running, leaving whoever was on the other side of that door to their own devices.</p>



<p>We got to the top of the prison cube and saw a horrible sight. The chains, each link being roughly ten feet wide and thirty feet long, groaned as they shook. We nearly thought they would break and send the prison cube into the water! While my friends steadied themselves as they climbed out of the cube, I looked out towards the Nether Sea. </p>



<p>There she is. The barge of Khar’shan, miles and miles away, but glowing slightly from some light source. I saw it moving through the water briefly, but then it was obscured by something positively <em>massive</em> stepping in front of it. </p>



<p>“Voeld,” explained Clio. “He’s the titan that pulls Khar’shan’s barge.”</p>



<p>Voeld and the barge were maybe two or three hours away yet. That gives us some time.</p>



<p>We raced back to the Gjallarhorn, explaining to Rendu what had happened. He began steering the ship behind the cube so as it block Khar’shan’s view of us as she got closer. And now, we had to decide how to proceed. What do we do? We got her attention. Now what?</p>



<p>There are a few dilemmas that we must solve. The first: what do we do when she gets here? From the stories, and from what I observed as Voeld dragged it closer and closer to us, Khar’shan’s barge is gigantic, far larger than the Gjallarhorn. Our ballistas may damage the outer hull somewhat, but we seriously lack the fire power to sink it. Even if Khar’shan just let us attack it for an hour or two, there’s no way we could bring it down. Right now, hiding our ship from hers seems to be the smartest option.</p>



<p>Second: how do we get on board? This one is kind of stumping us, but we came up with a plan. We’re going to try to sneakily fly in and land on the deck, then pull our our weapons and... attack? I guess? Sneaking in seems the best choice, though. Briar, Actaeon, and I can fly, as can all of our dragons. Actaeon can carry Clio. Briar can transform into a giant bird and carry Torag, Shadow, and Rendu. Shadow says he can cast magic on us all to make it easier for us to sneak aboard. We thought about having Brachydios and Dante provide a distraction, but Brachydios cannot fly, and if Dante falls in the Nether Sea, he’ll be lost.</p>



<p>Third: what do we do about Voeld? The titan will surely see us coming and will inform Khar’shan. But maybe that won’t be the case. Actaeon said that his sword, Titansbane, is desperately wanting to get back to Voeld. We might be able to negotiate with the titan.</p>



<p>Fourth: what do we do once we’re on board? Our plan is simple: kill the Lady of Dreams. But how do we go about doing this? Kano suggested what Clio had said days ago, that we could try to bribe her by playing the Royal Game and having her renew the Oath of Peace. But no, that will not work. Amalj’aa still wants the divine sparks of the titans so he can wreak havoc on the Emerald Isles and then the rest of Xerender. The Oath of Peace must end, no matter what. That will only be okay if Khar’shan and Amalj’aa die. </p>



<p>We have a couple of lingering questions that we pondered, too. For starters, if Khar’shan is a god, what happens when she dies? Dia said she and the other Five resurrect at the Temple of the Five Immortals in Ellandyr. Can Khar’shan do this, too? Dia seems to think that’s not possible since the Five stole that power from the Twin Titans. If we kill Khar’shan, she should stay dead. And so, how do we kill a god? Actaeon has Titansbane, and we all have powerful magical equipment from the Mithral Forge. According to the Oracle’s prophecy, those weapons should be enough. We can only hope that’s the case.</p>



<p>Actaeon had an idea for dealing with Voeld. He wants to bring Titansbane to him and see what happens. Is it possible that Voeld will want to work against the Twin Titans? Or will he take Titansbane and use it against us? Actaeon says the risk is worth trying, and we all collectively agreed.</p>



<p>We’re going to spend some time patching ourselves up and getting ready. It’s going to be one hell of a fight. Kano insists on coming with us, as do Dante and Brachydioss. Ilharg offered to join us as well, eager to finally repay us for saving him months ago. Blessed Ilharg, you don’t owe us anything! But we do appreciate the help.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Khar’shan’s barge is huge! Far larger than the legends say. To say it dwarfs the Gjallarhon is putting it quite lightly. The Gjallarhorn’s masts nearly reach the top of the prison cube, but the deck of the barge reaches pretty far above it. Fortunately, Rendu had the Gjallarhorn hidden behind the cube. It would have been so obvious had we been right out in the open.</p>



<p>The titan pulling it is somehow bigger. Voeld is unimaginably large. If he swings a single punch, he will break our ship in two! But we also learned that wouldn’t be a problem. Voeld, you see, is blind. He had his eyes taken by Khar’shan ages ago, and guides the barge by feel alone. He knows the waters so well that he doesn’t need eyes to see where he is. Furthermore, his mouth is sewn shut by a long black rope.</p>



<p>As the rest of us stayed low and out of sight, Actaeon (with Clio on his back) flew straight up to Voeld. Actaeon whispered into his ear, “If you can hear me, nod.”</p>



<p>There was a long pause before the head made the smallest movement.</p>



<p>“Good,” continued Actaeon. “I’m going to free you and cut the rope on your mouth. <em>Please</em> don’t kill us when I do.”</p>



<p>It was an exercise in trust, both for Voeld to let Actaeon take Titansbane and slice through the ropes on his face, and for us to let Voeld free without him attacking us. Would he fight us? Or would be betray Khar’shan?</p>



<p>Betray. Oh, absolutely. Apparently for Voeld, there was no question. “Ye have my everlasting thanks,” he said, his voice low and whispered. “Titansbane... my old weapon. Ye brought it to me?”</p>



<p>Actaeon offered the sword, though the titan could not see. “Will you take it back, and join us against Khar’shan?”</p>



<p>The sound of her name caused the titan to flinch. “Nay, even with my blade, I have no power anymore. My hour is long since gone. Little would it do to have Titansbane in my hand again. Take it upon yourself, stranger. But why are ye here?”</p>



<p>“We’re here to kill her.”</p>



<p>Voeld nodded again and sighed. “Were it possible for me to aid ye, I would. Ye go to your doom, perhaps. There are ways to fight her, though. Weapons she has, stored in her armory. Take them up if ye wish, but know they are cursed, as cursed as she.”</p>



<p>And then, the large chain in Voeld’s hand, the chain he used to pull the barge behind him everlasting, fell into the depths of the Nether Sea, never to be seen again. His large and calloused hands flexed, and we could see the indents on his palms from pulling the barge for countless years. One hand pointed behind him. “Down there. Ye shall find entrance if ye wish to move in secret.”</p>



<p>Clio asked him, “Is there anything we can do for you? Some peace we can offer?”</p>



<p>“Peace,” repeated Voeld. “There shall be no peace until the sister and the brother are dead. But I will wander the sea here, going at my own free will now.” In his blindness, he turned to Actaeon and Clio. “Free them. Free my creations from her grasp. My fey...” Then he took a massive stride, shifting the water below him, and began to march away. Khar’shan’s barge remained behind, anchored by the chain that once drove it.</p>



<p>The entrance Voeld spoke of was easy enough to find. Down near the water, there was what appeared to be a small dock with a few rowing boats within. Actaeon, Torag, and I stepped in first to assess what we found in this area, and we were surprised to see people there! Not monsters or aberrations, but just people. Five men were resting on the docks by the boats, and a single woman was speaking to them. When we entered, they all stopped and stared. </p>



<p>“Oh, hello!” said the woman in a syrupy voice. “We weren’t expecting guests, but I am most pleased to see you. Our festivities will begin shortly. Won’t you join us?”</p>



<p>She walked towards us, gliding almost, reaching a hand out to Actaeon.</p>



<p>And Actaeon plunged Titansbane directly into her chest. “We’re not here to talk,” he seethed.</p>



<p>The woman fell back, flailing and screaming, transforming from the beautiful woman into something more sinister and hideous - that of a centaur-like creature, but with everything below her waist an emaciated lion or cougar. The men by the rowboats all shot up, drawing weapons, too.</p>



<p>Torag and Shadow leapt over Actaeon and I and attacked. In a few strikes, the woman monster fell dead at our feet. I lifted up by holy symbol and cried out, “In the name of the Five, <em>we’re not here to talk! L-Like he said!</em>” Admittedly it wasn’t the best thing to yell out in a fight, but I guess it did the trick. Four of the five were burned away, disappearing in the searing light of the silent goddess.</p>



<p>To the last man, Clio called out, “I’ve got questions. Talk, and live.” But the man launched himself at us, knife in hand. Clio, with a flick of her wrist, sent psionic energy at him and he fell dead in the water.</p>



<p>“That’s that!” I said. “Let’s keep moving.”</p>



<p>There’s a door here that opened up to a hallway with more doors. Maybe we should stick together and-</p>



<p>Then Torag opened a door, snorted, and charged. Dammit!</p>



<p>The room was filled with strange relics, some ancestral items of some kind that Khar’shan must have been collecting - a fancy quill, an ivory box, an apple-sized cube (but with more sides?), a mask of an elven woman, and a platinum coin. They were being attended to by two small girls, both giggling as Torag charged them. Torag made a few attacks before one cast a spell on him. “I think you need to go kill your friends, minotaur,” she said, staring towards us as we followed him in the room. </p>



<p>Shadow, Clio, Briar, and Actaeon all threw weapons and magic at the girls, both of whom transformed into more women monsters, while I cast a spell on Torag. It dispelled the magic that was charming him, just before Torag could come at us. He blinked, mumbled something like, “Heh, that was almost bad,” then turned and, with a quick stroke of his sword, took the head off the woman monster that charmed him. The other tried to run, but Actaeon put a spear through her.</p>



<p>There was a door at the end of this hall, too, and we briefly wondered where to go. We decided to split up, if only for a few minutes. Scouting ahead seemed wise here. Torag and Shadow went to the door at the back of this hall, while the rest of us went to inspect the doors in the previous hallway.</p>



<p>Actaeon, Clio, and I went to the first door in this hallway and found a room that was impossibly long. There were stairs at the end of it, and they seemed completely out of reach somehow. The room is lined with skulls, all of which seem to be moving on their own. There’re a lot of whispers here, and it is very unsettling. We decided to come back to this room later. The stairs here go up, presumably, to the top deck, and that will be our last destination.</p>



<p>The next door led to what looked like an armory. There were weapons everywhere, lining the walls and floors. Four pieces in particular stood out among the rest. One was a large axe, another was a shield, one was a scimitar, and the last was plate armor. Unlike grey steel or silver mithral, these were made of some purple and black metal that none of us could identify. We figured these might be the cursed weapons that we can use against Khar’shan!</p>



<p>But before we could do anything with that information, four men in this room all started attacking. They transformed into strange hairy beast forms, snarling and feral. Just as we were about to fight, the door at the far end of this room opened. Torag and Shadow came in, having come around from the back! They dispatched two of the feral men while Actaeon and Clio took down the other two.</p>



<p>Should we take up these weapons against Khar’shan? It seems scary to do so. They're cursed, but they also... what? Are more effective against her? We didn’t really know for sure, so we ended up just putting them in our packs for now.</p>



<p>One door remained down here that we hadn’t tried yet. Shadow very carefully turned its knob and opened the door.</p>



<p>The room here is lavish, comfortable, and smells strongly of the finest incense. Colored candles are on nearly every surface, giving the room an otherworldly glow. And in the center of the room were two women. Not like the women monsters from before. These were different. They were adorned with red and black feathers. Their eyes were a piercing red color. And their hair was fiery red, almost moving like it was actually made of fire.</p>



<p>We had seen these women before, the day when Helios broke the Oath of Guest Friendship.</p>



<p>One Fury said to the other, “Look, sister! The Heroes of Prophecy are here. This day shall be interesting.”</p>
