<p>When Briar got back to the ship, she only said "I need some time." She walked past us all and went down below deck. Her tattoo was obviously still on her, and we knew what that meant: she was still cursed. </p>



<p>Dammit! What did Khar'shan do to her? Ugh, this is so frustrating. We've been making good progress for weeks now, and this is just another setback. But this one hurts. Briar was finally supposed to be free. </p>



<p>While we were considering our next moves, Azorius's Keledone returned to us and delivered a few new items. Actaeon has magic flying boots like me now, Shadow got a new cloak, and we got a few large shields and a staff that shoots fire. Briar and I can already do that, so we ended up giving the staff to Nikya. She and Torag seemed very pleased to have it. </p>



<p>I have a problem, Heath. A problem with my teammates. I don't think they trust me. I don't know where this thought comes from, but the more I think about it, the more I've had this thought for a long time. Consider this, Heath: everyone polices me on everything I do. They tell me what to do, they push me around, and they... I think it's because of my age maybe? I'm the youngest here. Briar is only a year or two older than me, but she's not as <em>childish</em> as I am at times. I think that makes me less trustworthy in their eyes. They have to put it to a vote if I'm to buy something, or they want the <em>literal baby dragons</em> to watch over me and make sure I don't do something idiotic, or-</p>



<p>I'm stronger than they think I am. I know it! I can manipulate my magic with ease now. If I throw a blast of fire at an enemy, I can shape that fireball to not hit my friends, even if they're standing right next to the target. I can cast spells in quick succession. I can summon fire, I can fly, I can-</p>



<p>X<em>siol, nurti r'icin</em></p>



<p>I saw in our recipe list an interesting item. It is a golden fruit. It seemed special considering the item it required was an eternal fruit, a rare fruit that only grows on the Golden Heart. I figured this: eternal fruit + 1000 gold + Azorius's expert skills = a super cool magical item that will be very useful to us! Unfortunately I had to convince my party that this was a good idea. It seemed smart to me, but they all-</p>



<p><em>Nutri r'icin</em>, I just went downstairs to find Briar. I took Zirconis with me. I think she needed some comfort.</p>



<p>We found Briar downstairs and she was sobbing, scratching at the tattoo on her back. It took some consoling before we could get any words out of her. The curse wasn't broken. She fought against that wretched cerberus and brought her ancestors a single day of peace. "I had my chance, but I didn't take it," she moaned. </p>



<p>But I think she did exactly what was right. Self-doubt is something I think all of us are prone to do at times, and Briar is no exception. She did the right thing. Slaying them and damning them to eternal horror and punishment was too great a price to break her curse. It would benefit her and her alone, and Briar is too selfless to do something like that. Instead, she gave her ancestors a single day wherein they could be together without pain. That reprieve, I think, must be magical for them.</p>



<p>I told her, "Briar, you're strong. Much stronger than the rest of us, to go through life with something like that." I don't believe any of us could support such a weight even nearly as long as she has thus far. To know that you'll fall into an automatic and loveless love with someone, against your will, and you'll die after passing your curse to an innocent child? The strength and resolve that Briar has is much greater than she realizes. And I told her that she can handle it a little longer. The oath of peace will be over soon. We're almost there. And Khar'shan will die soon. The itch will be gone, not just for her but for her entire family and her lineage. The victory will be sweet.</p>



<p>I made my way upstairs to make her some muffins, and Zirconis came to help me. He can fly and reach the ingredients I can't. We'll take good care of her today while the others start working on their things. </p>



<p>We're off to the Island of Time now. Actaeon gave us a fright when he landed on Havarl to get the directions to the next location, but he said the voices weren't very convincing. Torag and his mother Ophea had some very awkward conversations about finally seeing each other after so many years. Torag seemed to suggest that Ophea's nice skin is because she was a statue for many of those 18 years - you know how certain stones can be used to scrub the body when one washes? Ophea seemed to disagree.</p>

<p><em>4 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 27 days remaining</em></p>



<p>We're approaching the Island of Time now. It's ominous. It should be like any normal island. But we've heard plenty of things about it that make us worry.</p>



<p>For starters, Enigma, the elderly man down below deck. He was a prisoner on the Isle of Yonder, having been a babbling mess when the League of Storms had caught him. Briar cured his madness a while back, and he's been pleasantly helping in our library since. Enigma told us that his madness came from the Island of Time when he found what we believe is the Book of Life. He could not remember what happened there, though. At one point, he found the book near a set of heavy metal doors, but a shadowy figure with strong wings appeared and he remembered nothing more. </p>



<p>Actaeon, meanwhile, was researching the Island of Time with some help from Sokrates, our local tome golem. They discovered that the Island of Time is not that different from the Maw of Havarl, in that the rumors state that landing there is almost certainly a death sentence. No one returns, and if they do, they are plagued with madness forevermore!</p>



<p>The group briefly discussed this. I'm the only one who needs the book, so it makes sense for me to go alone - just like Briar had gone alone. Only this time, we didn't have any confirmation that I <em>was required to go alone</em>, whereas Briar was. Since Clio, Rendu, and I still needed our dragon, the three of us had to land on the Island of Time. It made sense, then, that we just all go together. We supposed that was the best way to go forward.</p>

<p><em>2 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 25 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Within a mile of the island, things started to get weird. The shoreline was hard to see, even though we were close enough to make it out. A shimmer seemed to make it shift and move, and we couldn't get a clear view of it no matter than angle. </p>



<p>Briar tried a divination spell and asked for some guidance. Her prayer was answered with a cryptic message: "Do not look upon the Jewel of the Sea more times than fingers on thy hand, save for the thumb. Do not make a journey more once or thou shalt pay the price." We've not a clue what it means, but Enigma gave us an idea. He recalled a spyglass on the island somewhere that looked upon Ellandyr. And Clio reminded us that Ellandyr is called The Jewel of the Sea. Perhaps we are meant to not look through that spyglass more than four times?</p>



<p>As we got closer, though, the ship started moving on its own. Far too fast, actually. We felt the surge of the waters pulling us, circumnavigating the island at breakneck speeds, much faster than nature would allow. The sun and the stars spun in the sky above us, and only a few of us kept our heads while the rest blacked out from the sudden and nauseous movement. We tried to wake them up as the island of time came into view again, clearer now, but stranger still.</p>



<p>It is night here, and it will apparently always be night here. The sky is filled with numerous stars, many of which disappear or appear almost at will. The waters below us are still, though they drove us to an ancient dock. Torag suggested swimming in the water to see if something was amiss, and I'm glad he chose not to. Briar and Actaeon did a test to see how dangerous the waters were. Two frogs and a rat disappeared into it and never resurfaced. </p>



<p>The island is so odd, so ominous, so spooky. There are large chains, the size of ships, that lead up into the sky and out of view. They are holding something down. Or perhaps they are holding this island up. The sphinx didn't seem to mind it, though. She just said that we should be wary of the time we spend-</p>



<p>Oh right, the she-sphinx. I should mention that when we got off the ship and started to explore, she was there with us. It seemed like she had always been here with us, though. We were all very comfortable in her presence. She wasn't a threat, anyway. </p>



<p>Okay, so the she-sphinx said we should watch our time here. If we spend too much time, <em>he</em> will come and devour us - in soul, mind, and history. It sounds awful, and I wonder if its another sphinx. They seem to love this weird creepy stuff. And I remember the lotus witch! She seemed to relish devouring history - or at least the history of the poor souls trapped as children in her tower. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe <em>he</em> isn't a sphinx at all. Maybe <em>he </em>is some other alien thing? The she-sphinx told us that <em>he </em>allotted three roars for us, and that is how we would count our time. When whatever roared a third time, our time was up and we would be doomed.</p>



<p>As if by some strange magic, we all knew of three points of interest on the Island of Time that we wanted to inspect. The first was the top of the tallest hill. There, we would find a large stone table. After that, we were to travel to the center of the island and view a pit of stars. Finally, we would end at a nearby cliff that looked over some great vista. If time permitted, we would be able to safely board the Gjallarhorn again and leave this abysmal place. That is our hope, anyway. </p>



<p>The stone table was... offputting. It was exactly as I wrote - a large stone table - with twelve gigantic seats all around it. Five of those seats were taken. The first was by a large man the size of an ogre. The second was an amazoness with ancient armor. The third was a man decked in fine armor with a large spear. The fourth was a human with long braids in many colors. The fifth was one of the ancient dragonlords, Actaeon's friend Luis Dante.</p>



<p>Dante and the others were fast asleep. Nothing we could do was able to wake them. Yelling, pushing, prodding, nothing would rouse them. Furthermore, nothing we could do was able to <em>move</em> them either. Time for them stopped, maybe, and they were stuck like this. And yet, they were not dead. Their hairs had grown long and covered the table, but they breathed naturally and slowly, perfectly asleep. Clio tried reading Dante's mind, but all she saw were visions of him being accosted by the Primal Tide and ending up here somehow. His dragon was not with him when he succumbed to whatever horror is on this island.</p>



<p>With nothing more we could do, we decided to leave. Our time was wasted, and we heard a distant and terrifying roar. </p>



<p>"That's one," said Briar. We all knew what that meant. Two more, and we were doomed...</p>



<p>As we made our way down, Clio felt a strange sensation. Something was pulling her down the hill, faster than the rest of us. Not like a physical pull, though. Rather, she sensed something and it gave her haste. Briar, Shadow, Torag, and Actaeon immediately knew what that meant. Clio's dragon was here somewhere! Oh, how exciting! Clio led the group now, and we followed gladly. </p>



<p>At the center of the island, we found rivers upon rivers of magically charged water, all swirling in many different directions and surrounding a dark pit that led deep into the earth. Is it down here that Clio sensed something. Looking down, we saw heavy metal doors at the bottom of a winding staircase. The doors! This is what Enigma saw before he was attacked! We were on our guard as we started to make our way downward.</p>



<p>Things got a little... well... <em>alien</em>... for me. Alien. I can't think of a better word for someone like me. Something happened to me, and I don't even know what it was. My mind got jumbled and I couldn't speak properly. I started to panic. I couldn't get words out. Not properly, anyway. It was terrifying.</p>



<p>I think everyone was mad at me. They kept asking me, "Leef, what did you do?". How should I know? I was just trying to look where I was stepping! I don't know what happened! Why were they all so angry with me?</p>



<p>Clio cast a spell on me and my mind was eased. I scooted away from the edge of the stairs. Something about the void down there was frightening me, and they just kept asking what I did to make it happen? I just wanted to leave. Ugh, I hate it here! I don't know what madness came over me, but everyone was so angry with me. I don't want that to happen again.</p>



<p>But we're not done yet. Something alien was at the bottom of the stairs, standing resolutely before the door. It was like a sphinx, but its head was that of a great hawk or eagle. Its eyes pierced us as it growled, "Stay. One step closer and I'll end it."</p>
