<p><em>14 to Wakening Sun, Goloris, 10 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Between working on her cloak, we all got to meet together with  Clio and the Fates. Versi and Rhea seem fine with their new roles, trying to work out what that all entails. Most of it went right over my head when they were discussing it with us. Clio has been busy since she's been here, and not just working on her cloak. While we were delivering our friends back to their islands and capturing chimeras, Clio has been doing research and she has some important information to share with us.</p>



<p>She learned, like we did, that the waters of the Nether Sea are toxic. But unlike what we found out, she learned that there is some magic there, too. Originally, we thought that the Nether Sea had the power to petrify someone - not unlike a basilisk, to the point where we thought basilisks swam in the waters. That is not the case. There is some other magic, something <em>stranger</em> there that we don't fully comprehend. </p>



<p>Clio reminded us that it's not just Khar'shan that is down there. The Lady of Coins went to the Nether Sea as well, and she would be dangerous to encounter. Regarding the titans, Khar'shan sails the Nether Sea in a ship of her own. There is no wind there, so her ship is moved by the titan Voeld, who is chained to the ship and pulls it along behind him. Khar'shan may be surrounded by many of her minions, including some of her children, empyrean titans perhaps as strong as her. </p>



<p>Luis Dante then told us what he knew of the Nether Sea when he went there: there is a structure there, a crystalline pyramid called the Mirror Prison. That is where Dante hid the treasures of the dragonlords - or at least, so he thinks. He confessed he wasn't sure if that actually happened or not. He and his dragon, Brachydios, flew to the Nether Sea on Estor Arkelander's orders. Arkelander's campaign against the fey was going poorly and he did not want certain magical items to fall into their hands, so he sent Dante to hide them. He figured the best place to hide them would be the one place the fey feared to go, in Khar'shan's domain. Dante and Brachydios found the Mirror Prison and thought that would suffice. The problem was that they didn't know it was called the Mirror Prison. It just looked like a strange pyramid to them. They blasted it with lightning and created a hole in it, then went inside. And they were <em>immediately</em> accosted by the Primal Tide. The next thing he remembered was waking up on the Island of Time centuries later. Brachydios is missing, though we suspect he is alive, otherwise Dante would have perished without his bonded dragon.</p>



<p>Clio suggested we come up with an alternative plan to fight Khar'shan. If we confront Khar'shan and find ourselves outnumbered and outmatched, we may offer a challenge - the Royal Game. Such a game, with the fate of the world hanging on it, would attract the attention of the furies. They would oversee the game to ensure it was fair. Legends say Khar'shan is apt to cheat. Should it come to this, we thought Actaeon would be the best one to play against her. He and Briar both know the game well, but Actaeon's greater experience would serve him better. Briar would be a coach, I guess? Anyway, Actaeon agreed. Father and Clio both didn't seem to keen on the idea, though. I think they'd rather she just die than lose a game and be forced to leave the Emerald Isles alone. I kind of agree with that. The world will be better with her gone.</p>



<p>Azorius's Keledone came to visit us, delivering some presents from the forge. Briar and Shadow got a bunch of neat arrows, we got some new suits of armor, and just a <em>ton</em> of spears. Sixty, actually! We wanted more, but Azorius ran out of Mithral. So sixty of the one hundred crew under our command are armed with magic spears now. Just in case, you know? I got a neat shield and its very beautiful, with a lovely sun motif. </p>



<p>Also, <em>my golden apple came!</em> Oooo, it's so pretty! A while back, we were looking over Azorius's list of things he can make. One of those was a golden apple! There was nothing else with that, just the words 'golden apple'. No description, no idea, nothing. So I ordered it, after having to convince my friends it was worth it. Because... no one knew what it would be! And I got it today! It's... well, it looks like an apple that is made of solid gold. I don't know what I expected. It's a little heavy and incredibly shiny, almost mirror-like. I can see my reflection in it perfectly, enough that I realized my hair was a total mess (dammit, Briar, you're supposed to tell me these things!). It's almost mesmerizing.</p>



<p>Clio's off to finish her work, and we're going to take some time to rest for the next two days until she's done. Honestly, I feel like we could all use the rest. It's funny sometimes, thinking about magic. We take injuries, some grievous and some less so, and we use magic to heal ourselves, to close wounds, to revitalize us after losing blood, or to stop infections. Goodness, it's itchy, though. Having a few days where <em>that doesn't happen</em> is absolutely lovely. When the war is over and we win - and we <em>will</em> win - I'm going to borrow money from our group fund and buy a house by the sea. I'm going to buy a comfortable bed. And I'm going to sleep for a year.</p>

<p><em>12 to Wakening Sun, Goloris, 8 days remaining</em></p>



<p>The time is here. We've sailed away now. Back to the waters, and en route to the Nether Sea. Rendu gave us a strong tail wind to let the rowing crew rest. They'll have to take the brunt of movement there since we won't have wind in our sails anymore. </p>



<p>Clio's been using a new weapon we acquired a while back. It's a golden sword hit that, when activated, turns into a weapon of bright light. She's with Shadow, learning sword play. Rendu's quiet now, watching the horizons as we travel. Torag is exercising and training, almost non-stop now. Briar's been baking due to the stress, wishing we weren't going there at all. And I've been in my Book of Life. </p>



<p>Actaeon recruited Dante to come with us, seeing how he's the only one who has been to the Nether Sea before. To him, it was just a few short weeks ago. Actaeon gave him a suit of armor and Xander's axe, Wuuthrad. Actaeon asked him what to expect there. Dante said we would first have to sail into Baranthrum, the great maw of the sea. It was an opening, a powerful whirlpool, held open by the powerful hands of the Hundred Handed. Dante and Brachydios flew into it, and that was a nightmarish experience, one that made Dante shudder. But we would be sailing down there on the Gjallarhorn. That would just add more to the nightmare, flopping around on the ship without the ability to steer. </p>



<p>We spent most of the day getting our ship ready for the maw. There's nothing on the top deck now, except for the centaurs and anyone else who cannot fit into the tiny hold of the Gjallarhorn. They have ropes aplenty, hopefully enough to be safe while we fall into the Nether Sea. Inside the ship, everything is stowed away as best as we can, but every time we pass through a room, there's something else that needs stored. My medical room is the worst of it. There are bandages and splints and cotton and all manner of medical supplies. Being in here while we fall would be very painful. Tel and I tried to tidy up but there isn't much more we can do.</p>



<p>Tonight, the sky darkened early and the sea became restless. We're getting closer.</p>



<p>I looked into my mirror today, the one you gave me when we got married. You saw beauty in me, something I've never been able to see. Every day I wear a mask, someone brave, someone strong. How did you ever see me like that? My reflection is different now. For the first time in as long as I last saw you, I don't mind my reflection. I'm <em>me</em> now. I like that.</p>



<p>I don't know why, but I put that mirror in my pack. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><em>10 to Wakening Sun, Goloris, 6 days remaining</em></p>



<p>This morning, we arrived at Baranthrum. We knew we were getting closer to it. The sun never came up this morning, blocked by a storm above us. The ship began to move fast, much faster than we were rowing. We stowed the sails and pulled in the oars, and yet we moved faster and faster. We couldn't see it yet, but the maw was pulling us in. </p>



<p>We saw the hands in the distance, just above the water line, pushing the water out of their way, and then the sea dipped sharply down. Salt water sprayed everywhere, soaking us like rain, but it smelled different, saltier, disgusting. </p>



<p>Also, don't know how I forgot to write this, but Actaeon is wearing a sweater now. A nice little thing, very pretty, with silver buttons. He's wearing it over his armor. Sokrates made it for him, apparently. And it's getting absolutely ruined by this water and weather! What a pity! I shall have to clean it for him later.</p>



<p>"I'm coming for you, Khar'shan," said Shadow.</p>



<p>The world tilted violently to the side as we listed. Thank goodness we had the foresight to lock everything down! Though that still didn't stop us from having to hang on lest we fall out. I thought we would capsize, but just as we were, we suddenly jolted downward, bow first, into what felt like an endless, endless fall. The world spun wildly. There were flashes of color all around, sounds, voices. </p>



<p>I heard you.</p>



<p>But you weren't there.</p>



<p>And then, an ocean of blackness.</p>



<p>The sky above us swirled eerily in lavender, silver, and black. There were stars above us, but I think they were fake. They moved, ever so slightly, and seemed much closer than they should be. We thought we might be in a cave. It felt <em>wrong</em> to be here. The sea around us was no different. And continual expanse of darkness. The water was very still, not unlike a lake on a calm day. But this was no lake. This was something sinister. We heard absolutely no sound around us except for a hissing noise. Father looked over the side and reported that our ship was sizzling in the acidic waters. Ilharg, our boson, looked it over, all around the ship, and said that we were fine - for now. The magic of the Gjallarhorn would keep it steady, but with this much acid, the hull would not last forever. </p>



<p>That's okay, we didn't want to be here for very long anyway.</p>



<p>Dante pointed in two directions to places he had seen when he and Brachydios were here. The first was an island with enormous, colossal statues. He feared it and passed it by. The second was the Mirror Prison. We saw it ahead of us, the great glass pyramid. That would be our first target. There, we would find the treasures of the dragonlords, the fabled objects Arkelander didn't want the fey to get their hands on. Armed with those treasures, we might find ourselves much empowered.</p>



<p>The oars came out and the crew rowed in abject silence. Even the drummer muted her drum beats. </p>



<p>How dangerous was the water? We had to test. If anyone falls into it, can they be saved? Briar had an idea. She took from her magic hat a simple frog, and she tossed it over the side. But instead of splashing in the water, there was a flash of light! The frog was now an earth elemental, swirls of rock and stone and dirt, looking around confusedly as it sank into the black water.</p>



<p>Huh.</p>



<p>Briar thought to try the experiment again. As she put it, the creatures from her hat are not actual living creatures. They're conjured by magic, so hopefully we wouldn't feel bad about throwing them into the water. She summoned a small rat and passed it to me to see what would happen. </p>



<p>Today I learned I don't like rats. I <em>launched</em> it over the side of the ship with an embarrassing cry.</p>



<p>It plopped into the water and there was another flash of light. Instead of a rat, there was a clear pool of clean, pristine water, floating briefly on the surface before mixing with the rest of the acidic sea.</p>



<p>Briar tried one last time, pulling another frog from the hat. She passed it to Shadow and he threw it away. When it struck the water, the same flash of light appeared, and the frog became a tiny statue of a mouse, and it promptly sank as well.</p>



<p>Remember that spellbook you stole from the library when we were kids? I remember a particular passage, one about wild magic. Magic that seemed to be random and strange and cause chaotic things to occur. It seems to be very similar to what is happening here in the Nether Sea. It might not be wild magic exactly, but it might be related to it. Chaos as a force of power is a scary thing, and it just reiterated to us what we already knew: stay out of the water. We quickly passed the message around the crew.</p>



<p>Actaeon suddenly sensed something as we rowed closer to the Mirror Prison. He sensed a dragon, but something was wrong with it. He couldn't say what it was, though. Dante wondered if it was Brachydios after all these years. Was he still here? If Brachydios was alive, it would explain Dante being alive, too. </p>



<p>The pyramid is huge, reflective and sticking out of the Nether Sea like it doens't belong here. The lights from our lanterns and torches dance against its surface. Dante pointed us towards a hole in its southern side, the hole he and Brachydios blew open. With our sails stowed, our ship could fit inside, so there we went. The Mirror Prison was dark, except for our meager lights. Every surface in here was a mirror, some broken, some whole, all pointing in different directions, like the architect had not studied properly. </p>



<p>There was a bridge ahead of us, and a small island in the center of the pyramid. We brought the ship next to the bridge, but it was above us, just high enough to require climbing. Actaeon wondered if climbing would be too dangerous, though. Were there traps or alarms on the bridge that would alert some horror if we touched it?</p>



<p>But before we could answer, a loud cry rang out. We ran downstairs to the oar deck. One of the crew, Gill, was writhing on the ground, scratching at his neck. His nails cut into his skin, but instead of bleeding, the skin of his neck split in perfect, parallel lines. Then he stopped, calmed, the nightmare over. When he sat up, he was calm again, but <em>different</em>. The lines on his neck were gills, not unlike a fish. And his skin was clearer now, almost transparent like a sea jelly. </p>



<p>We asked him what happened. He only said, "I looked in a mirror."</p>



<p>He's cursed now, that's for certain. Once this is all over, Briar or I will restore him to his proper form lest his family back in Ellandyr think they sent him on an unsafe voyage. You know, going to kill gods and what-not. Why would he not be safe with us?</p>



<p>Stay out of the water. Don't look in the mirrors.</p>



<p>The island in the Mirror Prison had a pile of gold and gems on it. Dante thought that might be what we were looking for, as it looked like what Arkelander had sent with him and Brachydios. I cast a spell of magical detection and saw something glowing there. The treasures must be buried beneath, we figured. But still hesitant to touch anything, Actaeon, Briar, and I opted to fly instead, with Malkarian, Zirconis, and Telavasir beside us. The others waited on the ship, arming the balistas and watching for any sign of movement that wasn't us.</p>



<p>We flew to the pile of treasures. I don't think any of us are too interested in the gold or gemstones right now. My magical detection saw a few things down below, and we started digging, shuffling coins out of our way. Eventually, Briar pulled up a bow, very nice and made of some strange metal (perhaps Mithral?), radiating a magical enchantment. </p>



<p>Something in the water moved. Shadow, from the Gjallarhorn, whistled at us. But before we could react, the water broke and something enormous leapt out. A dragon, tained with a radiating black energy against its metallic scales, its eyes glowing an ethereal purple that glowed in the room. "Who ventures into my lair?" he growled.</p>



<p>We froze, unsure of what to do. Briar tried, "Friends?" But the dragon just growled and said he had no friends.</p>



<p>Actaeon took off his helment. "Yes, you do, Brachydios."</p>



<p>But Brachydios was cursed and could not recognize us as friends. He cried out that the dragonlords abandoned him here in the Mirror Prison for ages and ages, and he would not let us escape. He blasted black lightning at us - it nearly killed me right there. Briar and I both took the hit, and we fell into the coins.</p>



<p>From the ship, Shadow tried to distract Brachydios with arrows, but they clanged off his metal hide. He went to charge at us, but Briar and Zirconis tried something. Zirconis went forward, breathing his sleep breath at the monstrosity. It didn't work, but it accomplished what it was meant for - a distraction. Briar dashed up, breathing heavy, and cast a restoration spell on him. A strong one, too. There was a flash of light and a warm burst of energy around us.</p>



<p>When it was done, Briar backed away, slowly at first. Brachydios growled and shuddered, and then grew still. He looked around, quietly, at each of us. Then he turned to Actaeon and said, "Diomedes. I... I know you. I thought you died." Actaeon only chucked and replied, "Kind of. Only in ways that don't really matter."</p>



<p>"Brachy!" came a loud voice. It was Dante on the Gjallarhorn. He leapt up onto the bridge of the prison and dashed to us, embracing his dragon. </p>



<p>Brachydios - Brachy? - muttered, "I am seeing ghosts today. Luis? You are here? But what happened to me? How long have I been here?" We told him the tale, or rather, Dante did. He told Brachydios that when they were separated, Brachydios had been thrown into the waters of the Nether Sea and left there. The mirros in this Mirror Prison must have cursed him greatly, a curse that Briar was able to break.</p>



<p>The reunion was sweet, even in this wicked place.</p>



<p>Now that he was himself again, I asked Brachydios if we could continue sifting through the treasures to find what we want. Brachydios was confused as their orders were to hide them, not recover them. But orders change, and Arlekander is remembered only as a monster and enemy to the Emerald Isles. </p>



<p>We found more in the pile. We had the magic bow already, but now we found a great axe, a black helmet, a great bow with a chain for its string, a jug with a strange metallic liquid inside, and finally a black dagger that appeared to be stained with blood.</p>



<p>But as I picked it up, I heard a voice next to me. Estor Arkelander stood beside me, ghostly and terrifying, with his hand held out expectantly, "I'll take that, if you don't mind."</p>
