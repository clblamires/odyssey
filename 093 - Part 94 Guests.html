<p><em>2 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 25 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Briar moved to Clio, trying and failing to calm her apparent madness. She just clutched Leusinia's egg tightly. Actaeon shook Rendu next, and the aasimar started mumbling, too. He spoke of weapons and falling, but we really couldn't make out what he was saying. Torag thought he said the name 'Barry', but we didn't know anyone by that name. Shadow and Torag tried waking Yzzy and Dromoka. Ysgramor, the poor thing, was blinded somehow and couldn't see. Dromoka... could only <em>croak.</em> Like a frog. He couldn't speak, and he looked panicked. Torag, to his credit, just laughed and told him, "It's alright, kid. I'm here. Just stay by me."</p>



<p>My gauntlet was still aimed at the Sovereign of Time. "What did you do to them?" I asked, attempting to make myself look tough. The Sovereign saw through it. "Little bug, I've done nothing to them that I haven't done to you. They fell. And now they are mad." He said it as if that explained things. </p>



<p>Briar said, "A little mad is fine, I suppose," and she cast a curing spell on Rendu, bring clarity to his eyes in an instant. He didn't remember much, only falling. His angelic wings couldn't catch him in time and he thought he was going to fall for eternity. And then <em>poof</em> he was here with us! Briar's magic was spent now, though, and she couldn't do it for Clio or Yzzy or Dromoka. I tried calming Clio with a spell but it wasn't working. </p>



<p>While we were doing this, Actaeon had moved on. He shook his friend, Dragonlord Luis Dante, but the man did not budge or awaken. Actaeon turned and said, "What about this one? He's a friend of mine. Can we wake him?"</p>



<p>The Sovereign leaned in close. "If that's the reward you seek, then yes, I will allow it."</p>



<p>Hold up now! Each of us (who wasn't filled with madness or blind - poor Yzzy!) turned to the Sovereign. This was news. We were getting a reward? He laughed at us, pleasantly enough that our anger at him abated slightly. He swore that he would reward us for the fight as, he mentioned previously, he hadn't had good combat with mortals in almost one thousand years. As such, he felt it was the right thing to do: reward us for our triumph, so long as what we ask for is within his power to grant. "It is the way of things. You bested me. I am defeated. You've earned a magnificent feast and I shall grant you a reward."</p>



<p>We tentatively sat and began to eat the food, though nerves were high. We each had cuts and scrapes and bruises and our attacker seemed completely fine. But no, the food was not a trap or poison of any kind. Rather, it was really probably one of the best meals I've had in a long while - no offense to Briar, of course. We thought about it for a moment before offering some options for the reward we wanted.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Can you give us River and Rare? (No, the Lady of Dreams slew them and has power over their souls)</li>



<li>Can you teach us some really neat magic spells? (Be more specific)</li>



<li>Can you stop the Lotus Witch's curse on Scorpion Island? (Sadly no, that is her domain. We exiled her from our order, and as such we will no longer interfere with her affairs)</li>



<li>Can you kill or exorcise Estor Arkelander? (No, that is for you to do. The Lady of Dreams controls his curse. Deal with her to deal with him)</li>
</ul>



<p>His responses seemed fair, though I wonder how much power he really had. Like, he could manipulate time, right? I'm sure he could kick Khar'shan's teeth in if he wanted to. But anyway, we opted for a simpler approach. Our reward was requested as such: awaken Luis Dante and give him to us, and cure Clio, Ysgramor, and Dromoka from their madness. The Sphinx grumbled at this, saying this reward was much more than we had earned. I suggested that we're bleeding and sweating all over his lovely table and island and that's honestly his fault. He sighed and conceded. Clio snapped out of her madness and asked why she was covered in grape juice - Oh right, we wanted to feed her, too, but she was all <em>oooooooo crazy</em> at the time, so Rendu started feeding her grapes, hoping she would instinctively chew them. She didn't. She's completely covered in partially chewed grapes. Anyway, Clio snapped out of it, Dromoka started talking again, and Yzzy was able to see. Thank the gods for that!</p>



<p>Luis Dante awoke with a shake from Actaeon. He seemed confused at first, not realizing that nearly five hundred years had passed since he had seen the Emerald Isles. His dragon was missing, but since Dante was alive then his dragon must be alive, too. He believed his dragon was in the Nether Sea. Estor Arkelander had commanded him to hide certain treasures there, but something escaped and Dante lost his dragon and his sense of self - only recently awakening here on the Island of Time centuries later.</p>



<p>We thanked the Sovereign of Time for the hospitality - at least, hospitality after trying to kill us - and the whole world went white. Not just for me, as it turns out. My head spun and I felt dizzy, light-headed and sleepy all at the same time.</p>



<p>I was suddenly on the Gjallarhorn again, lying in my hammock with my wounds bound with bandages. What had happened? I sped up to the top deck, surprised to see the sun rising gently in the east. Malikos caught sight of me and ran to me, asking if I was alright and how I was feeling. It seems the crew suddenly found themselves no longer moored to the Island of Time and had suddenly been drifting in the sea. When no one in particular was looking, they found us suddenly on the top deck, all passed out and sleeping soundly. The crew took us to our respective rooms, tied our injuries with bandages and slings, and made us as comfortable as they could. Nothing they did could awaken us. </p>



<p>It's a new day, apparently! We're exhausted but fine now. </p>

<p><em>1 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 24 days remaining</em></p>



<p>I decided to just start a new entry in my journal since it's a new day anyway. Actaeon is taking a raft over to a stationary rock so he can get us the proper directions to the Garden of Helios next, while the rest of us figure out what we're doing. Briar and I helped Clio get the incubator set up and put Leusinia's egg in it. She's a radiant dragon of some kind, we think, so I put some holy magic into the incubator and now the egg is shining like the sun. It's pretty and all, but none of us expected it to be that bright. A little too bright, perhaps.  Rendu is showing Dante around the ship and getting him caught up with history since he's been gone so long. </p>



<p>Somehow in the conversation, it came out that Rendu is the only Dragonlord who hasn't actually seen all of Actaeon's face. Actaeon, you remember, always wears a helmet that covers everything. We can sometimes see his eyes shining from the helmet, but that's about it. The idea was quite comical! Actaeon has been hiding his face for a long time, so long that I think he sometimes forgets that everyone seeing his face anymore really isn't an issue now that we're almost at war. Anyway, Rendu has made it his life's mission to get Actaeon to take off his helmet now. Clio even tried to help by moving Actaeon's helmet telekinetically, but the gladiator is just too fast, haha!</p>



<p>Why the Garden of Helios next? It was more of a matter of deciding where to go. There are a few islands left to explore before we try to kill the Twin Titans. The Garden has a dragon egg on it, potentially. I wonder if it is mine, or if it belongs to Rendu? But Helios had invited us, so that was important. After the trials and tribulations of where we've been going and what we've been doing for the last few weeks, we decided that a little "break" was needed. If anything, I'll need a few days of downtime to fix the rips in everyones' clothes. </p>



<p>I contacted Helios and told him we were on our way. He seemed most pleased to have us! After reporting that we had indeed helped him with his little problem (that is, Jadaferlas has been very sacrilegious towards the sun god), he warmly invited us to join him at his garden and that he would be preparing a very special feast in our honor. </p>



<p>Two feasts in just a few days! How nice is that?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><em>The Day of Burning Sun, Goloris, 23 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Today is the Day of Burning Sun, and what a glorious one it has been! We started with a nice sacrifice on the top deck and some very lovely prayers. It'll be the last day of sacrifice we'll get to celebrate before things start getting really messy. There's still the Day of Verdant sun, but we may be in the Nether Sea or in Ukaizo at the time, so it's unlikely we'll be celebrating anything. </p>



<p>Leusinia hatched today! Oh, and she's so beautiful! Very furry, somehow, and very shiny. The others, the metallic wyrmlings, are quite pretty in their own right, but Leu is different. Even Actaeon, our resident dragon expert, didn't know what to make of her. Leu is very sweet and apparently loves listening to stories. Ooooh do I have some wonderful tales to share! We briefly talked about names, too. Do parents name their children before or after they meet them? Leu knew her name before she hatched. Mine was branded on my neck, though it's more of just an ugly scar now. Shadow says he named Rare after he met her. I wonder.</p>



<p>The rest of today went by uneventful, though we were ever watchful. We're closer to Ukaizo than we ever have been. The sky is darker over here, like a storm gathering. Nevertheless, the journey was fine today. </p>



<p>Tomorrow, we arrive at the Garden of Helios. I think it'll be very nice to visit him! I haven't met many gods but-</p>



<p>Wait, that's not true. Flee, you've met a ton of gods now! Dia, Vaevictus, Aminatou, Azorius, Helios - That's way more gods than most people would have met, I'm sure. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><em>10 to Verdant Sun, Goloris, 22 days remaining</em></p>



<p>This morning, we found ourselves arriving at the Garden of Helios, a smallish island covered almost entirely in a very dense fog. There are cliffs on al sides, too, with plants and shrubbery spilling over the sides. It's really very lovely! There are sounds coming from the island, all the way up those cliffs. It sounds like trumpets, but low and deep. Father thought they were animal sounds. Torag and I climbed the cliff to investigate - me with my winged shoes and Torag with his... uh... muscles -  leaving a length of rope behind us so the others could follow once we made sure the coast was clear.  Father was right! The island was dotted with large brontosauruses, each bigger than the last, all moving in large herds. There are shepherds, too. They are cyclopes, surprisingly, and they've all large sticks or canes on them to move the dinosaurs where they want them to graze. The large trees around the island are their food, and the cyclopes drive them between sources, presumably to make sure they don't kill an entire tree by eating all its leaves. In the center of the island is a vast forest, though it appears to be glowing somehow.</p>



<p>I flew back down to tell the others what we found. As everyone climbed up, we heard Torag speaking loudly, "Hello there!" Loud enough for us to hear him and get us to climb faster, I should think. Everyone got to the top, we saw Torag facing six cyclopes. The cyclops in front said in a low but friendly voice, "Welcome to Garden of Helios, great sun god. He welcome you to island. He send warm greeting and invite you to feast. He is kind an gen-russ" (I think he meant to say generous). </p>



<p>We heard Rendu curse behind us and we all turned. He had been wearing his cyclops gauntlets for some time now, clasping them onto his wrists before we went on any of our adventures. Today seemed like a normal day so he had put them on, and he later told me he was worried about wearing them in front of these cyclopes. His gauntlets were made from a cyclops, after all. </p>



<p>Which, now that I'm thinking about it, is super gross.</p>



<p>The cyclops shepherds pointed towards the forest at the center of the island, then dispersed to go back to their herds. We went onward. I admit, I was quite excited! Helios seemed like such a nice god back when we met him outside Ellandyr. The others were a little nervous, though. The cyclopes were never really our enemies, but their cousins, the gygans, certainly had it out for us. Father suggested I do a little divination <em>just in case</em>. So I did. I lit some incense while we were walking and asked Kiora what we might expect.</p>



<p>It was a whirlwind of fire that I felt, but not the pleasant warmness of a flame I could control. This seemed different, erratic, and utterly terrifying somehow. My heart raced, and I didn't know why. I honestly don't even remember drawing out my wand. It was just in my hand, and my eyes sought anything that might attack us. The others saw this and we started moving more cautiously. Was this a trap? Was Helios bringing us in for some god ritual thing? To be more prepared perhaps, Rendu plucked some strings on his lyre and made Shadow go invisible, and the tabaxi man followed us silently.</p>



<p>We came to the center of the forest and found ourselves in a small temple, surprisingly small for how lavish it was. The stones were both shaped like the sun and decorated to look like it. Everything was hyper-reflective, to the point where it was warming up the area considerably. There was a dais in the center of this small temple with a sapphire stone in its center. We stood on it and Torag touched it. With a quick <em>bang</em>, we found ourselves inside a deeper part of the temple, larger but furnished beautifully.</p>



<p>At the front of the room was a large table filled with fancy foods. Helios, the golden sun god, had his back to us when we entered, for he was listening intently at the nereid man nearby who played a lovely tune on a large kithara. Helios heard us enter and turned. "Hello, my friends! Heroes of Prophesy, it has been some time since we last met. Please, come and eat. I'm so happy you are here!"</p>



<p>He presented us with an enormous meal, brontosaurus steaks being his chef's specialty. As we circled the table, looking hungry at the food, Briar and I offered the sun god a few gifts we had been making for him during our trip. I presented to Helios a rose gold shawl that he quickly wrapped around himself with a smile, and Briar offered him some sweet tarts she had made especially for this meeting. Helios, delighted, asked us to dig in, and we did just that.</p>



<p>The party was fancier than we expected (thank the gods I was able to get everyones' clothing stitched up and cleaned before we came) and the food was amazing. Briar's food is quite good, to be sure, but Helios's chef had access to many different ingredients and spices, some of which Briar had never even heard of. She and Father began taking notes. Some of the vegetables here were abnormally large, too. I've never seen an ear of corn as big as a sword, or grapes that you have to cut with a knife to fit in your mouth. Helios lounged in gold-plated furniture with bright red cushions and motioned for us to do the same, waving it off when one of us would accidentally spill a bit of wine on them. His musician continued playing the kithara. Briar tried offering the nymph some food, but he politely declined. </p>



<p>The feeling that came over me when I was divining returned suddenly, without warning. I felt the hairs on my arms raise, and I looked about. Was something amiss? No, that can't be right. Helios is engaged with us and seems to be incredibly gracious as a host and perhaps a new friend. His musician, who we later learned was named Notus, seemed weird though. I watched him for a while. His fingers seemed tired, like they were stinging. How long had he been playing?</p>



<p>Rendu brought it up, sensing something. He recognized the kithara immediately - it was one of the instruments of Palladia, which meant Notus was one of the Four Winds. He asked Helios about the kithara. Helios brushed it off, though, "That simple thing? It was being played by a talented musician, Notus here, outside of Ellandyr not long after I met you all by that shrine of mine. The Kithara is a little dull, but the music is quite pleasant and I was entranced! Notus has been with me ever since!"</p>



<p>We all caught on pretty fast. Helios didn't say it, but we knew what he meant: Notus was not given a choice. Was this the strange feeling that my divination had picked up on? Rendu slyly offered to play it so Notus, tired as he seemed, could rest and eat. Helios was hesitant until Rendu told him that he was a musician as well. Rendu began to play, a beautiful and lively tune. </p>



<p>Helios asked us to indulge him on tales of our adventures. I began to weave a tale of our time on the Golden Heart and our triumph over Gishath, the Sun's Avatar. With a little magic and moxie, I told him of our arrival and the hunt. I described the traps we set and how each of us fought bravely against the Sun's Avatar and the lesser avatars around him. Helios seemed impressed, even laughing about the Sun's Avatar being <em>his </em>avatar - he was the sun god, after all, so this kind of made sense.</p>



<p>"It's been quite some time since I've been entertained like this," said Helios at length. We had been talking and eating and even singing to the tunes for a bit. Helios suggested some dessert. "How about something truly delectable? I haven't eaten such accomplished heroes in a very long time."</p>



<p>The words were dark despite Helios's bright demeanor. We were left with our mouths hanging for a moment before we realized that Helios's trap had been sprung, and he transformed into a massive and monstrous golden form. The man disappeared, replaced by the shiniest dragon any of us had ever seen, except maybe Leusinia. </p>



<p>This felt <em>wrong</em>. That feeling from my divination again. This was wrong! It made me nervous, angry somehow. Why did I feel this way? But my feelings of strangeness only increased when I went to draw out my wand and Torag's hand fell upon my shoulder. He shook his head and just said, "Put it away, lass." I looked at him, confused and amazed. Why not? That off-putting feeling from my divining struck me again as I looked at my companions. <em>None of them had their weapons drawn</em>, despite Helios's clear threat to our lives. Why not?</p>



<p>Leusinia tried to fly behind Clio to hide. Helios snapped his fanged maw at her, trying to bite and kill. The teeth snapped near, but Leu was fast as she darted away. And still, no one fought back. I heard a metallic sound, and Torag drew his sword, igniting it in black flame. But even like that, he kept the sword at his side, unmoving. I gaped at him, horrified. Why weren't we fighting back? He saw this and just shook his head again. "We are his guests," said Torag, as if that explained anything.</p>



<p><em>WHAT THE **** DOES THAT MEAN?</em></p>



<p>Helios, his voice deeper and more metallic now, laughed. He roared loudly, startling us, then exhaled a stream of golden fire onto Briar, Rendu, Notus, and Zirconis. Notus looked badly injured, but Briar and Rendu weathered the assault just fine. Rendu even absorbed some of the fire, being barely burned by it. Zirconis, being a fire dragon himself, was quite unbothered. But that was enough. Torag drew his sword and shouted, "Oathbreaker!" He charged and slammed his fiery sword into Helios's scales.</p>



<p>The others did the same. Weapons were drawn now. And just like that, the weird feeling I had been having about this was gone, now replaced with a feeling of resolve. What was happening?</p>



<p>Clio cast a hastening spell on Actaeon, and Actaeon did the same as Torag, stepping forward with weapons drawn. He and Malkarion attacked, surprising Helios from the onslaught. Helios flapped his gigantic wings to fly away, knocking a few of us down. Rendu, sensing Notus's injuries, used the magic of his golden shield and created a spell of healing for everyone, to which I crawled into as fast as I could. Briar cast a spell at Helios, throwing him backwards as Shadow and Yzzy attacked, arrows and dancing swords flying through the air. I blast out lightning at Helios, and I shouted at him and everyone else, "What's going on?"</p>



<p>"Oh, I do enjoy a finely roasted meal," growled Helios, his dragon features curling into a twisted grin. He blasted out fire at us again, but Rendu's shield absorbed most of it. Malkarion and Leusinia got to cover, and Dromoka dodged out of the way at the last moment. Zirconis stayed with his mom, absorbing all the fire magic again and being entirely unaffected by Helios's breath.</p>



<p>Helios looked angry now. His fire was hot and it was destroying the temple around us, but we were unmoved. We had fought dragons before, some stronger than this. Was this dragon supposed to be a god? He burned and injured us, sure, but we've seen worse than this. <em>Recently</em>, in fact. Jadaferlas might have been stronger than Helios. Was that the reason he wanted her dispatched?</p>



<p>We readied ourselves to continue the fight, but we heard a sudden <em>snap</em> sound coming from seemingly everywhere. Then a second, then a third. Next to me, Rendu smiled. He must have seen the confused look on my face, so he just pointed forward. </p>



<p>The smile and laughter of Helios faded in an instant, and a look of fear and dread came over him. Three creatures appeared, each on different sides of him. They looked like women but they were taller than most I had seen, and they had a single bat-like wing sprouted from their back. One looked furious. The second looked psychotically happy. The last looked vacant. Each held a whip in their hands, and with one movement, they each snapped the whips, restraining the large form of Helios in an instant. And then, they began to scream. The screams were echoing in the temple, and we slapped our hands to our ears to muffle the noise. Each of the women drew a sword with their free hand and, still screaming, launched themselves as Helios. The dragon gave our a cry, but it was drowned by the women. When they struck him, a blast of black smoke filled the room. The smoke cleared and Helios was gone!</p>



<p>Torag just nodded as he sheathed his sword. Rendu did the same. As did everyone else. No one else seemed bothered by strange women exploding a dragon in front of them? Briar saw my confusion, and she was the one to explain it to me. "The law of the Emerald Isles is this: when you are invited into someone's home and gifts are exchanged and you are fed, you enter into an oath of guest friendship. No harm should come to the guests in your home. Oaths in the Emerald Isles are binding contracts between us and the gods." She pointed at the black spot on the floor where Helios once stood. "Helios broke the oath. So the furies took him."</p>



<p><em>That is what happens when you break oaths in the Emerald Isles?!</em></p>
