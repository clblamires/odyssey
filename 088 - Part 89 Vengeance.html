<p><em>8 to Burning Sun, Goloris, 31 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Before Jadaferlas was upon us, the Lady of Coins let loose a series of poisonous arrows. We tried to dodge them as best as we could, but Torag and Shadow each took a few hits. The dragon roared, and the dragons with us (Malkarion, Zirconis, Dromoka, and Ysgramor) were frightened. Briar stayed back with them to keep them safe while the rest of us charged forward. Torag was faster than the rest of us, though, and he quickly got out of our reach. Jadaferlas targeted him specifically, clawing and biting at him while he swung with his sword. </p>



<p>As Jadaferlas and Torag sparred, Clio and Shadow went for Moxena. They were furious at her for her betrayal. I tried calling out to her, desperately trying to get her to join our side. "Moxena," I cried, "Jadaferlas will die today. Make a smart choice. Swear to me an oath of service and I will see that you survive."</p>



<p>A blatant lie, perhaps? I think I meant it in the moment. I don't like how things ended up with her. It keeps me up at night thinking that we allied with someone and betrayed their trust. The fault lies with us. But not solely. She had the chance to make amends. She had every opportunity to see to her own safety and aid us. Or leave us alone entirely. But no, she chose to side with an evil sort. </p>



<p>Am I surprised? No. Honestly, no. I've spoken at length with Clio and Briar about this. I believe that everyone can be redeemed. Am I going to raise my hand against her? Yes, without a doubt. If Moxena were to surrender to us, I would sincerely make her case before my companions. She did wrong, and maybe she can be redeemed. But if my companions believed the world would be a better place without her in it, I would not stop them.</p>



<p>You could have been so much more than this, Moxena. </p>



<p>As Clio and Shadow went for Moxena and the rest of us went to back up Torag, we were accosted by marble golems that rose out from the ground, servants apparently to Jadaferlas. They held Ilharg and Sel-Makor back, while the rest of us tried to dodge past them to get up to Torag and Jadaferlas. The golems were strong, though, and they were hard to break. I couldn't burn them with fire, so I had to play backup. Briar, too, as she assisted the baby dragons when they were attacked by a golem.</p>



<p>Torag was injured pretty badly when Jadaferlas flapped her wings and flew up into the air, gliding back towards the pool of water near Vaevictus (knocking me down on my bottom, incidentally). By this time, we had injured her a bit. Arrows and spells had blasted into her scales and she was panting heavily. Briar had an idea and cast a spell on Torag, transforming him into a fearsome tyrannosaurus. A Toragasaurus, as it were. But as she did, Jadaferlas just laughed and cast a spell of her own, casting a charm effect on him. Toragasaurus turned on us and growled. I quickly cast a calming spell on him to clear the charm, then climbed onto his back. "Let's go, Torag! Pew pew pew!" I shouted, casting fireballs into the air all around us. Toragasaurus roared and sped off after the green dragon. </p>



<p>We caught up to her in the pool of water just as she had finished submerging herself in it. Most of her injuries had been healed by the waters somehow. But as we were in for a shock, just as much as she was actually! Clio had teleported herself and Shadow up to the top of the cliff. There was a loud explosion as they appeared, and Clio cried out in dismay. The shock of the spell had killed the woman up there! Moxena, suddenly injured and seeing she had nowhere to go, looked horrified. She twisted a ring on her finger and then disappeared into the shadows and was gone.</p>



<p>"COWARD!" shouted Shadow, fearlessly. He swung his swords wildly in her direction, but the Lady of Coins was already gone. We lost her again!</p>



<p>Jadaferlas turned her furious attention back to Toragasaurus and lunged. They traded blows and bites, their blood discoloring the once-clear water beneath their feet. I got knocked off of Torag's back and down in the mud just as a marble golem came at me. I dodged it just as Jadaferlas desperately tried another charming spell. Toragasaurus was too indignant for the magic to take effect - or so I thought. Instead, Jadaferlas had charmed Actaeon. Actaeon had followed us up to the pool and was trying to break Vaevictus's chains. He turned and charged at Toragasaurus and me, but I cast an anti-charm spell on him, too, ending the spell.</p>



<p>Rendu flew up high into the air and began to pelt Jadaferlas with magic. Shadow fired arrow after arrow. Clio sent out a shockwave of energy. Jadaferlas, in her ire, still focused solely upon Torag. Toragasaurus lunged at her as she flapped her wings to fly away, but his dinosaur fangs instead sank into her neck. He twisted, and with a sickening sound from her jaws, Jadaferlas the Venomous expired and fell lifelessly into the mud. As she did, Toragasaurus roared, his shriek turning into a gutteral yell as Briar's magic faded and he became himself again. </p>



<p>Without Jadaferlas's magic, the marble golems ceased moving. Seeing that it was clear and safe now, I quickly flew up to the cliff. Clio was knelt over the body of the woman. There was still time, we thought. I cast a resurrection spell on her. The diamond I pulled from my spell pouch splintered in my hand into a dust of crystals, and I said a prayer. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>"Spirits of the beyond, guide this soul back to the light.<br>By the grace of the divine, breathe life anew."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The magic vanished from me and I fell weak. I knew the prayer and incantation, but this took a lot out of me. It worked, though. The light left me and went to the woman. Her eyes fluttered open and her wounds closed. With tears in our eyes, Clio and I helped her up to her feet.</p>



<p>She is Ophea, Torag's mother. We learned this later. She didn't even recognize Torag as his change to become a minotaur was years after her abduction eighteen years prior. They hugged, a little awkward at first, but Torag softened in her arms. Then he picked her up and nodded at his father, and they headed back for the ship. </p>
