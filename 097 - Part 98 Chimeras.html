<p><em>Day of Verdant Sun, Goloris, 12 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Our adventures on Chimera Island came about due to two things. First, Azorius had long ago given us a list of things he suggested we create at the Mithral Forge. One of those things was a certain staff that could heal people, close wounds, and provide vigor to the injured or exhausted. It seemed like wisdom to us to have such a thing, though we were not sure we would have the time to go here. The second reason we came here was because of this: Father had announced to us that we could <em>make</em> time to come here. He had a goal: capture and domesticate a chimera.</p>



<p>Absolutely none of us wanted to rain on his parade here. The idea of capturing a chimera alive was already something seemingly unfathomable to us. The idea of him <em>taming</em> a chimera seemed completely impossible. But then again, as he was apt to tell us, he had been very successful capturing a number of creatures. In his past before joining the military of Ellandyr, Shadow was a farmer. Or he worked on a farm? Or he just... I don't know... had a lot of animals? I am not entirely sure. Either way, none could argue his logic. He had a very solid record of capturing beasts, and we couldn't deny that. Plus, as he said, we had time. </p>



<p>I feel bad for Clio! She would have to miss what would turn out to be an utterly ridiculous adventure. Briar and I already made plans to tell her everything. And, as you shall see soon, much of what happens absolutely must be from Briar's memory instead of mine. I was a little out of my mind for a spell.</p>



<p>We approached the small, curved Chimera Island just before taking our lunch. The island was craggy with a bit of fog at the tips of its mountains. The waters were calm, menacingly so when seeing what lay in them: perhaps a dozen or more ships, all wrecked, stuck on the rocks or in various states of sinking before striking the reefs below us. Most of these wrecked ships were old, as if they had been here for an age. They were covered in algae, crawling with gulls and crabs, all with their sails torn and shredded from the storms of the past many years. </p>



<p>We lowered our sails and rowed in between the wrecks. As we did, we heard a cry from some of the folks on the top deck. They pointed up into the sky at something, barely visible from here. It flapped its large and heavy feathered wings, and a cry came from it, like the roar of a lion. But then we heard another sound from it, like the sound of a great eagle (Briar makes this noise sometimes). Then finally one more sound, a scream of a horse in pain. </p>



<p>Side note: no one knows what horses are over here. They're not native to this land. I tried to draw one once, and Briar (in her centaur form at the time) took offense to the drawing. She thought I was being inconsiderate of her four legs, as if my drawing was some amalgamate of a centaur and a hideous creature. She doesn't understand.</p>



<p>Anyway, this creature was a chimera. Kind of. I think. I had spent a few moments in the library and had Sokrates teach me what a chimera was. He showed me two different tomes, one with a physical description and one with an extremely crude sketch. A chimera, according to the lore, is a single beast made up of three separate beasts, taking traits from each one. There is no consensus on what beasts are part of a chimera, but the books both suggested the following: dragon, goat, and lion. It was the head of a goat that we needed for Azorius's crafting.</p>



<p>This... wasn't it. This creature had, according to Shadow when he told me later, the body and head of a great eagle, a lion with horns (what?!), and a unicorn. A unicorn! Oh, how I have longed to see one! But not like this... It was pretty terrifying to see. And it was racing right towards us.</p>



<p>Briar cast a quick blessing on everyone to prepare us. Shadow got onto Helios's magic chariot and activated it, summoning the golden horses (HORSES! They exist, Briar, and they're not monsters!) and taking off into the sky. Torag grabbed onto Shadow and went with him. Actaeon activated his flying boots and took off as well, all eager to meet the chimera head-on. Only upon taking off did we hear Shadow call out to us, "Don't kill it! I want it!" and he held aloft one of the keeper stones to capture the creature.</p>



<p>Briar and Rendu and I were left on the deck, watching our friends race forward to face off with the monster. Rendu had the crew load the ballistas should something go awry. I meant to help him when a blast of hot, acrid water struck our ship from below. Attuned to the ship as he was, Rendu felt the pain and reported: something attacked us from the water! I looked over the side and saw... </p>



<p>Oh gods, what did I see? </p>



<p>Chimeras, you see, come in <em>many</em> forms. We were not expecting lion + eagle + unicorn. That was, on its own, was already a wonder. This was something else. This chimera swam in the water. It had the body of a shark with long legs armed with terrible claws, and three heads like the other chimera. These heads were shark + a pair of sharp teethed fish. And it <em>stunk</em>. I don't mind seafood, usually, but this thing turned my stomach. </p>



<p>That wasn't the worst of it. The worst was when I hit it with my lightning gauntlet. Parts of the creature sizzled and <em>cooked</em> as I struck it. It smelled like the worst soup one could ever imagine. </p>



<p>The sparks of my gauntlet seemed to have caught Torag's attention. He leapt off the back of Shadow's chariot and into the water, then swam (ran?) to the water chimera, crashing into with with his sword. The water chimera's teeth bit into the wood of the Gjallarhorn before turning at Torag.</p>



<p>Briar, seeing Torag falling and dashing across the water, came over to me to see the hideous creature. "He needs backup!" she cried. I nodded in agreement and prepared to charge my gauntlet again. Then, I felt a shove. The world spun as I heard Briar call out, "Sorry about this!" and I fell into the water and-</p>



<p class="monster-text"><em>OH</em></p>



<p class="monster-text"><em>OH YES</em></p>



<p class="monster-text"><em>OH IT IS LUNCH TIME</em></p>



<p>My memory here is a little hazy, so I had Briar recount the story to me.</p>



<p>She polymorphed me. I didn't expect this at all. She turned me into a great dinosaur, fearsome with swords for teeth and spears for claws. I roared mightily as I crashed onto the water chimera. It had been preparing a chomp on Torag, but I was now quite large and distracting to it. It focused its bites on me now instead of Torag and the Gjallarhorn, but I weathered it. My skin was thick like boiled leather and my fury was great! I clawed and clawed and clawed at the monstrosity while Torag stabbed again and again with his sword. The chimera must have feared for its life. It tried to swim away. I bit it as it tried, holding it there as Torag finished it with one final stab.</p>



<p class="monster-text"><em>I HAVE TO EAT IT</em></p>



<p>Briar, perhaps feeling bad for what she did to me, had meant, I think, to call me back to the Gjallarhorn. I got distracted apparently, though, and pulled the dead chimera to the bottom of the water to... eat it. Gods, that's disgusting. I am lucky Torag swam down with me and pulled me off the thing. As we swam about, I began to <em>hunt</em>. I wanted <em>more chimera meat</em> or something like that. Underwater, I found a cave, and I swam towards it. Torag followed. And then, splash! Briar transformed into a reef shark and followed us as well.</p>



<p>We three surfaced in a dark, underground cave system. Briar, back in her normal form, gave us a light and she and Torag climbed up onto my back. I stomped through the cave, eager to eat again (ewww), but Briar and Torag instead directed me out of the cave and into the sunlight on Chimera Island - we found our friends standing on the beach waiting for us!</p>



<p class="monster-text"><em>LET'S GO BACK IN AND EAT MORE CHIMERAS</em></p>



<p>What happened with them while we were underwater and underground? Well, Shadow was eager to tell me the tale later. He evidently didn't even notice Torag leaping off to fight a different chimera. Father focused on the one in the sky. He fired arrow after arrow, trying to down it or at least tire it. Actaeon, meanwhile, wrapped a cloak around one of his spears, fashioning himself a club (for a knockout, he tells me), and they positioned themselves above the sky chimera. It breathed a blast of hot white energy at them, scaling them a bit, but then it tried to dive and get away. Actaeon fell upon it, falling and falling, until he brought his club-spear onto one of its heads. It was weakened and that was <em>just enough</em> of a distraction for Shadow to strike it with his keeper stone, capturing it for himself. </p>



<p>His elation was cut short when he and Actaeon returned to the Gjallarhorn. Where were Briar, Torag, and Leef? Rendu told them what had happened. They hastened to follow us before Shadow thought better of it. Based on our last dilemma on the Isle of the Exiles, he thought, "Leef and Briar can take care of themselves. Plus, Torag is with them! I'm sure they will be fine." Rendu and Actaeon agreed, so they moored the ship and rowed out to the beach. That's where they met us.</p>



<p>We had slain one (gross) chimera and captured another. This wasn't enough, though! We needed a chimera with a <em>goat</em> head - Azorius was very specific in his instructions. We resolved to go into the cave and look around. While I was stomping about, Torag reported to Briar that he smelled something foul and the two of them took great care to guide me out of there. More chimeras must have been in the cave, so our group went together to go inside.</p>



<p class="monster-text"><em>YES I GET TO EAT CHIMERAS I AM SO EXCITED</em></p>



<p>I roared, naturally. What else is a giant predator dinosaur supposed to do when on the hunt? Briar shut me up pretty fast, though, dropping the spell and returning me back into the form of Leef. I wretched <em>immediately</em>. I shall never eat fish again! I felt absolutely awful. Now that I was in my right mind again, I had vivid memories of eating that awful thing under the water. Eww eww ewwwwwwwwww!</p>



<p>Vegetarianism! That's me now! No more meat! I shan't look at fish again with a hungry eye for as long as I live!</p>



<p>Alright, I'm normal again, whatever that means. I have my faculties about me and I'm uninjured. That's a good thing! Our group went back into the caves, following Torag's nose to try to find any chimeras we could find. Briar, Zirconis, Tel, and I stuck close together in one group. Shadow, Yzzy, Torag, and Dromoka were the other group. Actaeon, Rendu, and Malkarian were the last. We snuck around, silent as we could, searching for any other chimeras.</p>



<p>One was asleep. It had heads of bears, cockatrices, and elks (interesting side note: no one has ever seen an elk either! What a world!) We decided to not disturb this chimera. It had somehow slept through my roaring, but Actaeon wasn't taking any chances. He tied the sleeping beast down, then took a sack and covered it's cockatrice head. "I am <em>not</em> turning to stone today," Actaeon announced once his work was done. We nodded and continued.</p>



<p>The next chimera was not asleep, though it was chewing on something and seemed completely distracted. It was an eerie purple color and had heads of a lion, a cockatrice, and a unicorn. We opted to leave this one alone, too. But as we all moved away from it, we stepped into a larger room in the cave. Our light did not reach the ceiling fully, and the chimera up there descended on us. We barely reacted!</p>



<p>It jumped into the center of our group, scattering and separating us. This chimera had three heads - all dinosaurs this time - and it roared furiously, hungrily. Actaeon was injured pretty bad, but he shoved the creature off. Shadow dashed away to get a better vantage point, but he was accosted by another chimera - one I never really got a good look at. Shadow and Yzzy cried out as it jumped on them, then Torag ran into the dark to assist. </p>



<p>Briar threw out a healing spell to close Actaeon's fresh wounds, and he jumped forward onto the chimera on us. I cast a spell on him and Rendu and Torag, giving them a little extra <em>oomph</em> for their attacks. Tel and Zirconis were by me. None of us were paying attention to the other chimera we had left behind. It became interested in us and spit out a blast of black energy, hurting Tel and Zirconis gravely. But they were brave and fought back! And then boom! The chimera fell dead, and so did the one from the ceiling.</p>



<p>What's more is that Zirconis was the one who slew them both! Briar was so proud!</p>



<p>Shadow, Yzzy, and Torag came out of the shadows after a moment. Shadow held in his hand the head of a goat. Apparently the chimera in the darkness had a goat head. So now, we have what we need! Let's go!</p>



<p>Oh, but what about that chimera we tied down? Well, Rendu had that handled. He took our last keeper gem and captured it, too. He figured it would be good to let it loose in a room full of enemies. It's a little macabre, but it would definitely work as a distraction.</p>



<p>With that, we went back to our ship, rowed out, and set ourselves back on track to the Isle of the Fates. Yay, we get to see Clio again!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><em>14 to Wakening Sun, Goloris, 10 days remaining</em></p>



<p>We're back on the Island of the Fates and Clio is finishing up her cloak. It looks very pretty! The loom here is almost identical to the one my mother taught me to use back in Ylisse, though it's quite a bit bigger. Clio is as short as I naturally am so I'm sure a lot of what she has to do involves <em>getting up to move the shuttle</em>, over and over and over. That said, it's beautiful work. Not a single stitch is missed, and the color matches her eyes perfectly. She looks different now, after having left her for the last week. She seems brighter now. That makes sense. Her goal is finally in sight. </p>



<p>Speaking of goals, I think the weight, the <em>heaviness</em> of all of this is starting to settle on us now. It was always a burden, right from the very start, to be Heroes of Prophecy. The world is waiting with bated breath, wondering and hoping for our success. So many lives will be saved if we can just slay the titans and bring the Emerald Isles back to Xerender. So many stories, so many adventures, so many <em>people</em> will be cut short if we don't.</p>



<p>No pressure, right?</p>



<p>I've been reading that Book of Life for what feels like ages. I've taken to scribbling notes on old sheets of paper here and there, and I'm starting to get a good translation of certain parts and paragraphs. There are diagrams in the book that still offer nothing but confusion to me, but the passages around them are starting to make sense. Some of it talks about Eos or the Hundred Handed or even the gods of Xerender. There are large portions of the text that appear to be just names, and I can only assume its a genealogy of some kind. Other parts might be poems as the symbols all seem to end in the same lines and marks.</p>



<p>There are times that I am utterly frustrated by the text. Learning sylvan was <em>easy</em> compared to this, and that uses an entirely different alphabet. At least with sylvan, Clio and Briar were able to give me some direction and pointers, even signaling to me when certain dots over letters changed the tense or how suffixes aren't even a thing. This, though? I have no one to help me. I fear to show anyone what I'm reading, as per Enigma's warnings. When he looked in the Book of Life on the Island of Time, it sent him into madness. For my friends' safety, I've elected to not show them anything I've seen here. And so, translation of the Book of Life falls solely upon my weak, unlearned mind.</p>



<p>And yet, sometimes I catch a glimpse of something strange with the texts. The symbols seem to <em>shift</em> from page to page, in some pattern that is repeatable and recognizable to me. Sometimes they look like the alphabet of the common tongue, though the words aren't really <em>words</em> at all. Sometimes, the text looks like the sylvan alphabet with curves and lines and a flow like water. And other times, especially when I'm completely tired and barely able to keep my eyes open, the words look like my native language - draconic - and I get a sense of understanding. But then, I blink the weariness from my eyes and the words, the understanding, disappears anew, leaving me staring at a page of nonsensical scribbles and glyphs once more.</p>



<p>Tel has been helpful, though. She flutters around me or rests on my shoulders as I work, helping me collect my notes or acting as a soundboard for which I bounce off my ideas. She's quite smart for one so young, and she has good insights on things. It's almost always Tel who convinces me to take a break and get something to eat or visit with Briar or Father or Nessa (or Clio, too, now that she's back with us). Tel dragged me to the library at one point, eager to have me read her a story from one of the history books. As we did, we accidentally (kind of?) found ourselves looking at the lore of the Nether Sea. We shared what we learned with everyone else.</p>



<p>The Nether Sea itself is quite poisonous, such that even Jadaferlas might have taken ill from its waters. The water might even be described as somewhat acidic. Ships that travel there are eaten away by the water and the sailors are left to die, painfully and wickedly. The Gjallarhorn should provide us protection from it, though. We just have to stay out of the water-</p>



<p>Note to self: tell Torag to stay in the boat. No water running when we get there!</p>



<p>Let's see, what else can I write about the Nether Sea? Khar'shan's home is a ship not unlike our own. But unlike ours, it is not pulled by sails or oars. Rather, it is pulled by an elder titan, a great monstrosity, that walks through the water in endless pain, dragging Khar'shan's ship behind it. Also in the Nether Sea are old treasures of the Dragonlords, hidden there by Dante. Arkelander wants those treasures (or so his ghostly form informed Rendu once upon a time), but we're certain to not let him have them. In fact, Rendu is hopeful that one of those treasures might be something that can untether Arkelander from this mortal world. </p>



<p>Beyond that? It's hard to say. Stories of the Nether Sea are few and far between. You get there by sailing through Baranthrum, a great and terrifying whirlpool in the Forgotten Sea. It's a death wish for anyone not on an unsinkable ship like the Gjallarhorn. Inside the Nether Sea is a place called the Mirror Prison, a place where Dante hid the treasures. But in hiding them there, he made a mistake and unleashed the prison's only resident: the Primal Tide. That same Primal Tide that offered a truce between us and it - we left it alone, and it would leave us alone. For now.</p>



<p>What a scary thought! But then again, all of this is fearsome and frightening. </p>



<p>We all together had a long talk, us and our crew. We're going to fight for the Emerald Isles now. Anyone who was afraid would be left behind on the Island of the Fates, an honorable discharge from our service, and we would hold nothing against them. None of our crew left, though. They stayed and swore to continue with us, such brave people. None of our companions left us either. Instead, they sharpened their weapons, fixed their armors, and were ready to lay down their lives for the people of the Emerald Isles. And when our work is done, we will live long, peaceful, happy lives, fey and mortals together, until the coming of a new age.</p>



<p>We're stronger than we were before. Stronger than the titans realize. Their ambition and arrogance blinds them to reality - the reality that the fey and the mortals can and will coexist, peacefully and plentifully, creating a culture rich with life and happiness and knowledge. Together, we will build cities and cast down barriers. We will tear down the symbols of oppression, and raise standards of light and honor and integrity. No matter how the titans may try to divide us, we are strong as we stand as one.</p>



<p>Okay, a lot of that was very cheesy, but hopefully inspiring in some small way.</p>
