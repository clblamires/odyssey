<p><em>10 to Wakening Sun, Goloris, 6 days remaining</em></p>



<p>I reacted as anyone would: screamed like a child. Honestly, I don't think anyone would blame me. If you could see what Arkelander looked like, you'd be freaked out too!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://bunchofeyebrows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Untitled_Artwork-1024x907.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3189" style="width:470px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>I feebly tried to repel him from me with a blessing of Kiora, but I guesss Arkelander was a bit stronger than that, and he just laughed at me. He reached for the dagger again, but Zirconis and Telavasir stood beside me to protect me. Weakened as I was, I was not willing to let him get it. </p>



<p>Arkelander was not one to make it so easy on us, though. He summoned his thralls, the same that we had slain on the Gjallarhorn months ago. Skathon, Davos, and Metron were back, cruel and twisted as ever, along with several other undead sailors that Arkelander had slaughtered and sacrificed in his foolish attempt at power. I and the dragonlings beside me went to flee, and I called out to my friends. But Arkelander was relentless. He wanted this dagger. He <em>needed</em> this dagger. And before I knew it, I was dead.</p>



<p>I heard a roar from Tel. I suppose it was more like a cry. A sob. It rang in my ears as I fell into the dark waters of the Nether Sea.</p>



<p>But something happened. The wild magic of the water did something unexpected to me. Instead of transforming me into a beast or a statue or something else, it strengthened me for just a moment - long enough that when Actaeon's grappling hook snagged my cloak and pulled me back up, the last bit of life in me pulsed. My fingers closed around the cursed dagger instead of letting fall into the depths below.</p>



<p>In an instant, Clio and Leusinia saved me. Clio had teleported me to safety next to them, and Leu blew healing breath onto me, reviving me in an instant. I was alive! But the dagger! Where-</p>



<p>We heard a howl of fury from Arkelander as he swung a specral spear in nonstop strikes against Actaeon's shield. And I saw it in Actaeon's hands: he had the dagger!</p>



<p>My friends rushed to my aid. Or, I think they had tried to. Arkelander's thralls had us surrounded. Torag, Dromoka, and Ysgramor held off a group of them down by the ship while Shadow dashed up to the rest of us. Clio cast a haste spell on him, and he sped forward, firing arrows rapidly at the monster before us. Rendu did too, summoning his angelic wings and racing towards Arkelander with the fury of the gods. His chakram glowed in the darkness, striking again and again at Arkelander. The ghost was weakening.</p>



<p>Briar kept Tel and Zirconis safe by casting a powerful healing spell on them, one that doubled as a damaging spell against the ghosts around her. Dante and Brachydios ran to Actaeon's aid, trying their best to protect him as Arkelander continued his assault. </p>



<p>"Give me that dagger, traitor, and I will spare you!" growled Arkelander to Acteon.</p>



<p>Actaeon's answer was to stab Arkelander in the chest with the dagger.</p>



<p>Something changed in the air around us. It was like lightning striking a tree, or like a small ripple in a quiet lake. Arkelander shivered, and the ghosts surrounding us almost vanished.</p>



<p>That was the key!</p>



<p>Arkelander howled in rage, or maybe in pain. His form changed somehow. I think he looked <em>older</em> now, if you can believe that. His ghostly armor cracked. And his desperation grew. </p>



<p>This was a strange moment for me. My skin was charred and my chest ached where Arlekander had stabbed me. I felt defeated, hopeless. But I also felt... charged? The waters of the Nether Sea had reacted differently when I fell in them. Maybe it was reacting to the sorcerous blood in me, that strange mote of magic that existed in me since I was an infant. Whatever it was, it swelled in me, boiling into a fury, when I saw Actaeon take another hit. Clio guided me as I reached out and fired as much radiant magic as I could muster at Arkelander, striking him directly in the chest.</p>



<p>Arrows flew from Briar and Shadow, Rendu's weapon sparkled in the darkness, blasts of energy from Clio, all against the ghost. Actaeon struck him again with that dagger, directly in the chest. His armor crumbled entirely, and he aged again. Now, he looked like a man well beyond his years. His beard and hair went to his waist, scraggly and weak. His muscles shrivled, and his body emaciated. His shrieks were weaker now. We were killing him.</p>



<p>What must immortality be like? To linger beyond time, to exist as a god. The thought alone chills me. No, that's not right. Immortality terrifies me. If it is anything like what Arkelander endures, then I want no part of it. To kill, to betray, to sacrifice those who trusted you - all for the hollow promise of an eternity in the debt of the Lady of Dreams. That is not life. That is a nightmare. And tonight, Arkelander's nightware was coming to an end.</p>



<p>He tried to kill us with one final blow. An orb of ghostly energy began forming in his chest as he shrieked like a banshee. His thralls shuddered again, their forms dissipating slightly. We felt something in the air again, wicked, powerful. Actaeon cried out, "The orb! Destroy it! Quick!" And we focused our attacks and spells on it.</p>



<p>It was Arkelander's last ditch effort to get the dagger and kill us. And he failed. One shot from the hasty Shadow struck the orb, shattering it. A final strike by Actaeon from the cursed dagger directly into the ghost's heart. The world around us went still. The ghostly thralls of Arkelander wavered, their existence fading. Arkelander looked around, now frail and pitiful, and he knew it. All of his aspirations, his dreams, his schemes, all flashed before him. The friends he slaughtered, the sacrifices he made, the feyfolk he murdered, the deals he made, all for his chance at power and eternity. </p>



<p>Rendu robbed him of all of it.</p>



<p>Rendu summoned magic around him into a powerful roar. Its echo rang in our ears, deafening in its power. There was a scream, barely audible over the roar of Rendu's might. Arkelander's form twisted in pain, and then he shattered, scattering into countless pieces that fell harmlessly and lifelessly into the water around us. His thralls, the ghosts eternally bound to serve him, vanished with a sigh, never to rise again.</p>



<p>We won! The ghost of Estor Arlekander is no more!</p>



<p>I crumpled to the ground as the last traces of the Nether Sea's magic drained from me, leaving me hollow and trembling. Around us, the world roared with victory. Briar clung to Zirconis and Malkarian, Dante steadied Actaeon, and the glow of Father's magic finally faded. Rendu still hovered above us, triumphant, radiant, resplendent. Torag, Yzzy, and Dromoka finally rejoined us, battle-worn from holding the line behind us alone. Clio and Leu knelt beside me, thier voices distant, muffled by the overwhelming hum of my own exhaustion. And then, warmth. Telavasir's warmth, as she curled beside me, her voice a quiet tether against the darkness creeping in. I let it take me.</p>
