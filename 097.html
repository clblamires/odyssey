<p><em>8 to Verdant Sun, Goloris, 20 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Hmmm... Tyrone never showed up again. He seemed to be off pouting. We figured it was because he didn't like the fact that he wasn't helpful to us at all. Stavros and the others banished Keelan, but Briar convinced Keelan to make an oath with her. Tyrone had been trying to help us find the lute but he hadn't turned up anything at all. All is well, though. We found the lute and everything turned out fine.</p>



<p>Not... not really. There were some hiccups with the plan. But it turned out fine in the end.</p>



<p>First off, since Tyrone hadn't turned up anything at all, it left us to figure things out on our own. That wasn't a problem, we thought. We had some ideas. Clio and Torag were going to go talk to Idylla to see if she knew anything. Rendu and Shadow and Actaeon were going to ask around again. The Four Winds were fey bards, so we just had to find where any fey were on the island. Stavros said that there were no fey, except for a satyr that appeared a fortnight ago. He scampered away and no one had seen him since.</p>



<p>Briar had gone to speak to Keelan. She told me later that she sees Keelan as a <em>sacrifice</em>, not to dissimilar to any other sacrifice she's had to perform. He made an oath to serve her, so long as his service ends in his death. To Briar, that death needs to not be senseless, like "Go jump into that fire" or "Go fight those forty guys with spears". No, Briar wants Keelan's death to have meaning. Perhaps it is to make up for the senseless violence that he inflicted years ago, or to make up for the deaths he caused here on the Island of the Exiles. Either way, the worth of a soul is great in the eyes of our druid. Whatever fate has in store for Keelan, I am sure it will be worth it in the end.</p>



<p>As for me? I decided to get a bird's eye view on the situation. I flew up above the sky - yes, I can fly now! No winged boots required! - to see what could be seen. Goodness, this island is tiny. If the oceans receded, I think we might be on the tip of a very tall peak! Perhaps the island is as big as the grounds at the Temple of the Morninglord in Ylissee. Our temple, remember, had a great number of gardens around it, and land that the villagers leased from us for farming. This island is roughly the same size - which is to say, incredibly tiny compared to the larger islands we've visited. From up here, I can see the expanse of the whole thing.</p>



<p>The Island of the Exiles was chosen, presumably, because it was an unusable island. Small as it is, there is a jungle here, thick enough to make travel difficult. But even so, one could travel from the southern tip to the northern tip in perhaps only ten or twenty minutes, and that's if you're walking very slowly. It makes sense, though. This island is meant to be a prison for the exiles. The land is rocky enough such that no one could farm it, save for a few small gardens in the village. The villagers get their water from a spring in their village and, I assume, collecting rainfall. There's nothing here. What a horrible place to be! Helios was a fool to break a sacred oath of the Emerald Isles.</p>



<p>Speaking of Helios, I spotted a scorched section of the island far to the north. From my high vantage point, there was a smoky haze there still. Helios must have found his way there and settled. I called to the others what I saw. Briar and I would scout that area of the island while maintaining a healthy distance from Helios - we assumed he would be violently angry at his exile. Briar joined me along with Tel and Zirconis, and we flew towards the north. As I said earlier, the island is small. It took only a few minutes to get there. There was Helios, pacing and snorting in his golden dragon form, growling and staring at the sea.</p>



<p>Briar and I had the sense to hide ourselves below the tree canopy, and I send a message to Helios. "Helios, you're looking well! Have you seen a satyr? We're looking for him." </p>



<p>Whoops! Shouldn't have said that! He cursed at me and flew around trees, roaring and searching for us with a terrible fury. But Briar, Tel, Zirconis, and I were not afraid. He could not see us from down here. We stayed quiet and out of sight. But Briar said that certainly the others would have heard him. I sent a message to Clio to tell her that we were safe and that we would make our way back to the village. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that I misspoke when I send the message to Clio. It seems that I said the word <em>maybe</em> when telling her we would make our way back. Or perhaps I said <em>maybe</em> we were safe. I don't recall the words. Whatever the case, Father and Rendu assumed the worst. I'm a tad bit offended that they thought we could not fend for ourselves, but I understand. They were worried for their friends. The entire group decided to sneak through the jungle to get to us and save us from the dragon. Shadow barely glimpsed us as we snuck back. Briar transformed me and herself into hawks and we followed our dragons through the canopy and back to the village of the exiles. </p>



<p>Briar and I remembered that everyone else had gone down to the dock to talk to Idylla, so we made our way there. But as we got there, we didn't see anyone else, so we (in my mind <em>rightly</em>) assumed they had already spoken to Idylla and were back in the village somewhere. Maybe we missed them? Torag caught up to us and told us to go back to the village, so we followed him up, thinking we were going to regroup and see if something had to be done about the dragon. Instead when we got back, we found a very angry Rendu and Shadow. Shadow just muttered something like "I'm going to the boat" and he left. We misunderstood <em>again</em> and thought that Rendu must have found the instrument he was seeking. Maybe it had broken and that's why he and Father were of a foul disposition. I went with Father to the dock.</p>



<p>I didn't hear what happened in the village since I had gone with Father back to the Gjallarhorn. He did not say anything either. Imagine my surprise when the others came down to the docks and Rendu began shouting at me. I did not think I was doing anything wrong, so I flew down to him, addressing his challenge. I don't like to be talked down to that way. I've had plenty of people shout at me. Having a friend do it hurts. But I know why he did it. It came from a place of genuine concern and love, not from actual anger. </p>



<p>As I wrote earlier, I'm offended that they don't think Briar and I can protect ourselves. But how can I prove that? I see their point of view very clearly, to be honest with myself. Briar jumped into fire for her dragon egg. She wasn't given <em>any</em> indication from Actaeon how it felt to have your soul tethered to a dragon like that, or how it would feel for your heart to pull you towards it. She thought it was her curse compelling her to do something, and she sincerely thought she was fighting it. By no means does that make her incapable. And me? I used to be afraid to fight, unable to lift my wand against an attacker for fear of ending a life. I didn't even bother to try out for the Great Games. I mean, I knew I would lose, but why should that have stopped me from trying? </p>



<p>I live with that voice in my head constantly echoing the words I've heard all my life, "you're not good enough." I've been taught daily to ask the gods to forgive me because I am not good enough for them, that I have to change who I am to fit in with everyone, and that I have to wear a mask so that I pass as someone normal. As if it isn't allowed to be who I am. Even on my best days, I hear it over and over.</p>



<p>I'm stronger than they think. I'm stronger than <em>I </em>think. I know I'm impish and childish sometimes, but I don't think that makes me incapable. I am not as weak as I used to me. Things change. Even the gods I worship changed. The Morninglord isn't here, but Kiora is, and I think she's listening to me. I've overcome so much, and I know it, even if no one sees it. That should be good enough for me. Again, words were exchanged between myself and Rendu out of concern for our wellbeing, not for true anger. </p>



<p>After the squabble with Rendu, the group <em>finally</em> tells me what's going on. They spoke to Idylla and Idylla saw the satyr arrive, just like Stavros had seen. But unlike Stavros, Idylla saw where he went. He ran into the jungle with the lyre, just like Stavros had said, but Idylla followed him. He took up residence in a small ruin on the northeast shore, not too far from the scorched jungle where Helios was wallowing. That's where we decided to go.</p>



<p>It took naught but fifteen minutes to find the place. Again, small island. We would have gotten here faster but the jungle was thick and an angry Helios was still nearby. Fighting a dragon here would have been inconvenient. Past the jungle, we laid eyes on a shrine, some old temple apparently erected in Helios's honor. The gold statue of the dragon's man-form was covered in moss and vines, tarnished over many years, standing amid the wreckage of what was probably a very beautiful building once upon a time. At its feet was a simply clad satyr playing a simple melody on a simple lute. Zephyrus was his name - at least, that's what the Lotus Witch told us.</p>



<p>Rendu, still angry at me and Briar evidently, spoke in short bursts. He announced our arrival and said, "That lute in your hands does not belong to you. You stole it from the Temple of the Five. Hand it to me and you may see another dawn."</p>



<p>The satyr stood up, huffed but smiling, and replied, "I beg your pardon. I've done no such thing! This here is an heirloom of my family, passed to me by my grandfather, gods rest his soul."</p>



<p>A lie, and an obvious one. Torag just laughed, "What a lie that is!" But Rendu didn't smile. He just growled, "You're exiled because you did something stupid. You're doing something else stupid right now. You've one final chance. Give me back the Lute of Palladia or you will perish right where you stand."</p>



<p>Zephyrus just smiled, though. What a pity! He's very handsome and very talented, but not very bright. Standing up to us might be brave, if not foolhardy. I don't suspect any of us really wanted to kill him. We pleaded with Zephyrus, too: give us the lute and we'll be off! </p>



<p>But instead, he cast a spell.</p>



<p>Rendu reacted first, throwing a bolt of energy. The spell from the satyr, though, caused a mound of leaves and vines to rise up and block the attack. Zephyrus laughed <s>stupidly</s> merrily as he commanded it to attack us. Sadly for him, Clio was not in the mood for a fight, especially one where we so easily outclassed our opponent. She cast a spell and sent the mound of leaves and vines far into the jungle away from us.</p>



<p>The satyr paled when his summoned ally was suddenly not there. He retorted with another spell, trying to freeze Rendu on the spot. But Rendu erupted in white light, angelic and powerful, and he flew on gilded wings down to the satyr. The poor man turned to run. But Torag was faster. He caught up and called out, "We already gave him a last chance, right?" Zephyrus must have known he was beaten. He could have surrendered. He could have handed over the lute peacefully. Instead, the foolish man swung it like a weapon at Torag. Torag deftly caught it and stabbed with his sword. The satyr fell dead in an instant, but Torag saved the lute. It was undamaged and delivered promptly to the ever-radiant Rendu.</p>



<p>Briar does not want Keelan's death to be senseless. This was. What on earth was that satyr thinking? How could he have possibly thought he could defeat us in a fight? Even with a magical lute! Torag does not take a life without provocation. He's honorable. But Zephyrus? Not so much. This was completely avoidable. Through no fault of our own, he has passed on. Briar left his body with gold coins over his eyes. Then we left, leaving him to the jungle and Helios's broken and forgotten shrine.</p>



<p>We said only a few words to the exiles when we passed through, simply telling them that we were departing now. Shadow asked Idylla if she regretted anything. She had been banished and exiled because she was caught trying to manipulate Acastus for her own personal gain. She thinks differently. But she's beyond our help. They all are, save Keelan. Keelan called them all thieves, vagabonds, and murderers. I hate this island. I don't want to come here ever again.</p>



<p>On the Gjallarhorn as we sailed away, we were bothered. Father charged me to contact Helios again and ask him. I sent the message: "Why, Helios? You were worshipped as a god. You had so much. Why risk it all and break the oath of guest friendship?" The response startled me. In my mind, I heard his draconic form howl with anger. Not just anger, though. Confusion. He asked, almost begging for an answer, "What is the oath of guest friendship?"</p>



<p>I sent another message, "How do you not know about the oaths of the Emerald Isles? You're like me, aren't you? You aren't from here." To that, I got a snarky response, "Obviously not! I know nothing of this oath you speak!"</p>



<p>When no one was looking, I sent one final message to Helios, "You can only leave the island if you swear an oath of service. Swear it to me, and I'll set you free. Don't answer now. Think about it. I'll contact you again soon." I heard no response.</p>



<p>So, what's the plan now? Rendu spoke with Dia about recovering her instruments. She was delighted to be reunited with them again, but gave their charge to Rendu. While the instruments all have great combined power, they're still not enough to banish Arkelander from the Gjallarhorn. That power comes from the death of the Lady of Dreams. She's our next target as soon as Clio is finished with her cloak. To that end, we are now sailing towards the Island of the Fates once more. Clio will stay there and begin using that massive loom to make the cloak that will protect her from Khar'shan. And what will we do while she does that? It'll take her roughly ten days to fully finish it, so the rest of us will do some war preparations. I'll write more later.</p>

<p><em>Day of Verdant Sun, Goloris, 12 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Much time has passed since I wrote. We have been very busy, and war is almost upon us. I'm starting to get nervous.</p>



<p>Clio is gone now. She's with Versi and Rhea on the Island of the Fates, working on the loom to create her cloak. It's unlike any loom I've ever seen. Not long after my sixteenth birthday, Mother took me to the weaving room in the temple. There must have been a dozen looms there, each with someone working on, creating tapestries or rugs or something else. I could never get the shuttle to move smoothly. When Clio sat down at the loom, she seemed to grasp immediately what to do. We think that's because she's one of the Fates now. You know, intrinsic understanding? Despite my training in fabrics and dyes, there was really nothing I could do to help her. This is her path and her destiny. All I could do is point at things and say, "That part is the shuttle, that's the heddle, and that's the weft." That's right, Heath. I can <em>name the parts of the loom</em> but I've no idea how to really use it. How useful am I?</p>



<p>It was sad to depart without Clio. While she's usually aloof and solitary most of the time, we all got used to her presence in the library at almost all hours. It's weird without her. Briar and Zirconis were having trouble sleeping alone in that big room so Briar asked for me and Telavasir to move in with her for the time being. </p>



<p>Everyone else has been quieter since we left Clio behind. Maybe it's her missing presence, or maybe it's the looming war coming closer and closer all the time. Whatever it is, it's soured the mood of most of us and our crew. I think the others have been doing training or creating magical essences or something. I don't really know. Tel and I have been in the library with Enigma and Sokrates most days. I am studying the Book of Life. Enigma refuses to look at the Book of Life again, but Sokrates helps sometimes by assisting me in gathering my thoughts and writing down notes as I study the tome. There's something in there that is supposed to help me protect the Emerald Isles. Maybe it's a spell? Or maybe some ritual? I don't really know yet. Most of what is written is genealogy of people I don't know or descriptions of somatic spell elements. Hand movements, I mean. I don't quite understand what all I need to do, and I'm worried I won't know it by the time the oath of peace ends. </p>



<p>A few days ago, we returned to Talys. Princess Xoti and her guards disembarked. Xoti has since taken on the mantle of Queen now, and is going to be preparing all her forces to make for Ellandyr. They've sworn to defend the city with us. I don't know how big her forces are. I hope it's enough. But fortunately, it's not just on the Amazons to aid us in the fight. Days after that, we returned to Fire Island. Sel-Makor swore to explain our situation to Iquala. The Flamescars will join us in defending the city, too.</p>



<p>Over these past few days, I've sent magical messages to as many allies as we could get. I contacted Queen Anora of Altea, the Triad on Sleepy Drake, the tortles on Shell Island, and Yfalos of the Coral Throne. I sent a message to our acquired ships docked at the Mithral Forge that the crew there is to report to Aminatou in Ellandyr. And to Queen Aminatou, she should be expecting our forces to arrive over the next few days. I even tried contacting Damon but he's still not answering me.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is Leef. The Oath of Peace ends soon. Rally your forces and make for Ellandyr. Defend the city. The Titans must be defeated!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I only hope they all answer the call.</p>



<p>We've another problem, too. U'atu the Hundred-Handed is on the move. I had entirely forgotten about it. It was a repressed memory. I remember that night, the last night on the ship, when Mother and I were looking out towards the horizon. The captain told us that Ellandyr was just a day or two away now. The sun was setting, but something ahead of us blotted it out. Clouds gathered and rain began to fall. There was something ahead of us - a monstrous wave. I heard the crack of thunder and looked up in the sky. The face! The face of Amalj'aa, the Lord of Storms, was laughing. Or screaming. I don't remember. The wave shredded the ship and sent all but two of us to a watery grave. Mother, frail as she is, could not swim very well, and I lost her in the wreckage. The storm kept us apart and I thought she died with the rest of the crew. And I? I clung to a broken raft, waiting to die until Rastas and his son saved me. They brought me to Ellandyr, and I cried for days until Shadow found me.</p>



<p>I had all but forgotten about the wave that destroyed the ship. It was not summoned by the Lord of Storms. It was the Hundred Handed, the monstrous titan, walking between the islands of the Emerald Isles, completely disinterested in our ship. I could see him, the great titan moving underwater, causing the tidal wave in his wake. And here it was again. The Hundred-Handed was coming straight at the Gjallarhorn.</p>



<p>Rendu and Briar were quick to cast spells. Briar cast a spell that summoned a powerful gale, and Rendu created a wind elemental creature to assist. Together, they filled our sails with wind and carried us over the tidal wave from the Hundred-Handed's unconcerned path. The great titan never saw us, and even if he did, he had no care for us at all. Asking Kiora about the Hundred-Handed yielded nothing useful to us. The Hundred-Handed has been on the move, awake and angry, for an age now. It is looking for something, or someone.</p>



<p>Once we slay its children, Khar'shan and Amalj'aa, the Hundred-Handed will turn on us. What hope do we have to survive?</p>
