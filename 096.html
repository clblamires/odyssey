<p><em>8 to Verdant Sun, Goloris, 20 days remaining</em></p>



<p>Ilos told us that the Island of the Exiles was close, but we still couldn't see it. Our time today was mostly spent on preparations. Briar and Zirconis were making snacks, Clio and Leusinia were doing research, Actaeon and Malkarian were sharpening weapons, Torag and Dromoka were doing pushups or something, Shadow and Ysgramor were probably fishing at some point, and Rendu was with Malikos and Ilos. Tel and I? I spent the morning introducing her to everyone. She got to meet Razorclaw but found him kind of scary. Likewise she was a little scared of Sel-Makor. Ilharg found her delightful and the two bonded over some of Briar's candies. Nessa offered Tel a whiff from her pipe and I had to put a stop to that. To be fair, I don't think Nessa sees her smoking as <em>doing drugs</em> so to speak, but I'd rather my <em>not-even-a-day-old</em> daughter isn't exposed to that just yet. </p>



<p>As we approached the Island of the Exiles, we noticed something a bit strange. It was... goodness, the island is so small! There really isn't much to it. It's fairly flat and tiny with very little around it. In fact, Malikos was a little bothered when we got closer. There was a single beach ahead of us with a very small dock, but the landing spot didn't seem like a good idea. He asked Rendu if we could circle the island and see if we could find a better place to park the Gjallarhorn.</p>



<p>As we began to circle, Clio approached us. She said she had forgotten something, something of grave importance! Of all the materials she needs to use the loom on the Island of the Fates, she has everything but one: the blood of a gorgon. Once she has that and we're finished on the Island of the Exiles, we will sail back to the Island of the Fates and she'll make something with the loom - something to protect herself from Khar'shan. </p>



<p>No problem, we told her! Briar and I both have pretty strong connections to our gods, Kiora and Eos, so for the low, low price of about twenty five gold pieces (that we pay into my component pouch and the griffon on the other side provides us with very specific incense for the ritual), we can find out exactly what we need to do. I did the ritual first, lighting the incense and some candles. The sweet smell of the incense filled the air, and I clapped my hands. "Okay, Kiora, I need a peek into the future. A little hint, please. Where can we find a gorgon, or gorgon's blood?"</p>



<p>My answer came as a vision, but a very <em>specific </em>one. I saw myself standing outside a cave, pitch black and dark. There's a gnarled tree nearby, burned and scorched, and all around me are vines and plants - a dense jungle, so dense that I cannot even see through it. My focus is drawn to the growling sound from within the cave, though. I see two glowing green eyes and the sound of metal.</p>



<p>What the <em>what?</em> Alright, so I know what to look for, thanks Kiora, but I don't know <em>where</em> that is. To be fair, Kiora answered my question perfectly. If I saw this gnarled tree or a forest this dense, I'd know it in a heartbeat. The problem is that it didn't look familiar to me at all, nor did it to my companions. I created an illusion spell to show them what I saw, tweaking the scene ever-so-slightly as details came to my mind. No one recognized it, either. Ilos and Malikos both asked to see the vision, and neither of them knew it either. </p>



<p>Let's think, then. Could it be on any of the islands we've already visited? What islands had jungles? Fire Island could be correct, but Shadow pointed out that the jungle was wrong. This was dense, and the jungles on Fire Island were carved, almost manicured, by the people living there. Torag suggested it wasn't the Island of the Dragon as Jadaferlas was now dead and it was her magic that made the forest dense there; now that she was gone, traversing the jungle was not difficult at all anymore. It could be Talys but Xoti said she knew every aspect of the island and this could not be there. We asked everyone on the ship and no one recognized it. Clio and Leu went to the library to ask Sokrates if he knew anything about it, and even he hadn't heard of the place.</p>



<p>Shadow had a thought: perhaps it was on an island we had yet to explore? We were circumnavigating the Island of the Exiles right now and it had jungles on it. Perhaps the cave was here? Or perhaps it was on some islands we hadn't yet seen: Indigo Island, the Aerie of the Roc, or Chimera Island? Briar decided to try her divination spell. She went with Ilos down to the navigator's room and performed the spell. Hers is different than mine. She doesn't use incense in the same way. Instead, she cast a bunch of seeds into the air and they slowly drifted down onto the map. One seed bloomed - the location of the cave. But it was in the middle of the ocean. There was no island there at all! But Ilos corrected her: the seed landed on the Island of the Exiles. It is purposefully omitted from maps on Queen Aminatou's orders. The cave in my vision is here, on the Island of the Exiles!</p>



<p>The Island of the Exiles is a strange place amongst the islands of the Cerulean Gulf. The island is where prisoners are sent - those that the courts of Ellandyr see to exile. Committers of heinous crimes are sent here - murders, theft, or anything else deemed wicked enough by the courts. The island is also where oath breakers wind up. The breaking of an oath, as I learned on the Garden of Helios, is a terrible crime against the divine. The furies appear and take the oath breaker away, bringing them here. Others can be exiled here by popular vote - which, to me, seems strange. Shadow explained that the last person exiled here in such a way was actually Acastus's mother. The people saw her as someone who was using trying to influence Acastus for her own purposes. The people held a vote, and she was delivered here as punishment. </p>



<p>The criminal or oath breaker's sentence is based on their crimes. For most criminals, they are exiled here for a decade or longer. I imagine murderers stay forever. Oath breakers stay here forever, too. There is one way that they can leave, though: the resident of the Island of the Exiles must make an oath, solemn and serious, with someone who can take them off the island. In other words, if we see Helios here and he wants off the island, he needs to make an oath of service to us to make it happen. Meh, like that's going to happen!</p>



<p>Now that we know the cave and the gorgon are here, we have a plan. Shadow wants to find Helios and have a little chat about what happened in his temple. Rendu wants to find the last instrument of Palladia, a harp. The rest of us will go to this cave and... Oh, I'm not really sure how that will go. Clio explained that a gorgon is a monster in bull-form and it has a hide made almost entirely of shifting metal armor. None of us are really certain how we're going to extract blood from it. We'll figure it out later, I suppose.</p>



<p>Malikos was frustrated. He couldn't find us a better landing spot than the tiny beach, so we ended up mooring the Gjallarhorn there, pretty far off shore. We Dragonlords rowed in on our tiny boats, tying them to the small stone dock. By the dock was a woman, smiling but with severe eyes. She hailed us politely and seemed surprised to see the Gjallarhorn in the bay. She knew the legend of it, evidently. Her name is Idylla and she was happy to welcome us to her home. </p>



<p>Rendu asked about the lute, not disclosing its importance to him or its connection to Palladia, and Idylla responded that there are a few amongst the twenty eight exiles here that play music. Twenty <em>nine</em>, she corrected herself - a few days ago a large and very angry gold dragon appeared in the center of their village - the customary place of appearance when the furies brought an oath breaker to the island. The gold dragon - Helios - tried to fly away but didn't get far. Crimson red chains sprang from the ground and captured him mid-flight, yanking him back to the island. Helios, angry and defeated, disappeared into the jungle. Idylla said he looked like he was sulking. </p>



<p>As we spoke, more figures from the nearby village of exiles appeared: a large man named Stavros (recently elected the 'King' of the Exiles) and six men behind him. They came to welcome us and give us free reign to explore as we saw fit (for the exiles had no rights to stop us anyway). King Stavros asked if we were looking for someone, but we explained we were looking for three things: first, we were seeking a lute, one that would have come with a fey who arrived within the last two months. Second, we were looking for the gold dragon. And third, we were looking for a very specific cave. </p>



<p>For the lute, Stavros motioned to one of the men behind him. The man, a very stout and tired looking dwarf, offered the lute on his back, saying he was willing to sell it for a copper. The lute, though, was not the one we were looking for. This one was rotted a bit and even Rendu said it might not be tunable anymore. Briar looked briefly hopeful as she was wanting Rendu to teach her how to play a lute, but they both mutually agreed this was not the one to train on. Stavros suggested we go into the village to find other lutes. He knew who played and he was willing to round them up for us.</p>



<p>As to Helios, like Idylla said, he was probably somewhere in the jungle. Without his hoard and without his bravado, I can only imagine what a conversation with him would be like. Father intended to talk to him, but even he admitted he didn't know what would come of it. It was more of a curiosity than anything. He thought that perhaps Helios would be willing to make an oath of service with us, one that would send him back to the Garden of Helios where he could do all in his power to prevent the cyclopes from joining Amalj'aa's armies when the war begins. That, Father said, would be the only way he would ever get off this island. Perhaps Helios would be amenable to such an oath.</p>



<p>On the topic of the cave, I showed Stavros and his followers my vision. One, Briar noticed, seemed to recognize the place, but no one said anything. Stavros thought he knew the island through-and-through, though he admitted he didn't know every nook and cranny. He had recently been elected King of the Exiles for the third year in a row and most of his work over the past years had been trying to keep the peace between the exiles here. He explained that the last month had been awful: someone was murdering people. Four people had recently been turned to stone, and everyone was pointing fingers at one another. The petrified people were causing panic amongst the exiles, so Stavros had them shattered - much to our horror - and had begun an investigation. Stavros timidly asked if we, the famed Dragonlords, would be willing to help. </p>



<p>We Dragonlords held a quick private conversation. Offering to help them seems like the heroic thing to do, but what good will it do for us in the upcoming war? These exiles cannot leave the island, and even if they did, they were sent here for a reason. Would we want convicted murderers or violent offenders in our crew? As much as I am a follower of a religion of forgiveness and blessings, even this one is a stretch to me. We offered our help, but only so far as it did not impede our goals - that is to say, stopping the impending war. Should we solve the mystery while we are here, then that's good! But if we finish our other tasks here, our time is short and we have to leave. Stavros nodded and was gracious for our consideration.</p>



<p>He led us to the village of the exiles, a quaint place with very little of... well... <em>anything</em>. There were houses, tiny and sparse, with almost nothing of possessions. The exiles owned the clothes on their backs and a few knick-knacks here and there, but that was about it. The Island of the Exiles is a prison, after all. They eyed us cautiously, but perhaps a little hopefully as we arrived. A group came up to us, led by a rather charismatic man with a sinister smile. "Welcome, visitors! Whatever is your business here, I am certain that I can be of assistance." Stavros just grunted at the man - Tyrone - and told him to leave us be. Tyrone just mocked him, though, telling us that the murders on the island all happened under Stavros's watch. After hearing of our business on the island, Tyrone excused himself to find every lute on the island. We assume he wants something for the assistance, so I guess we'll figure that out when it happens. </p>



<p>The group split up here. Shadow and Clio wanted to find the gorgon and asked that Actaeon and I accompany them. Meanwhile, Rendu was going to look for Palladia's lute and Torag and Briar would back him up. We bade each other farewell and went to do our business.</p>



<p>Rendu, Briar, and Torag (along with their dragons) followed Stavros into his house to discuss the matters on the island. Rendu said he would know the lute on sight and they decided to let Tyrone and his cronies round them up. Stavros explained the situation on the Island of the Exiles in more detail. There is a rivalry amongst the exiles as we've seen thus far. Tyrone got himself exiled after trying to incite a rise against Aminatou and Acastus, and he's been wanting to be King of the Exiles ever since he arrived. Stavros, a convicted criminal himself, believes that the King of the Exiles should be working towards keeping the peace and making sure the exiles live out their sentences. Tyrone sees the position more as a means of amassing power - though in what way, Stavros isn't sure. </p>



<p>The problem is that the people who were killed were all supporters of Stavros. Without their votes, Stavros was afraid that the vote for King might go to Tyrone instead of him, and that would be dangerous. Briar asked how so, and Stavros explained: much of Stavros's work is to make the residents feel <em>safe</em>, especially the three women residents. There is one exile, a man named Tadd, who was exiled after murdering six women in Stygian Row back in Ellandyr. Tyrone, as Stavros put it, simple doesn't care. If he is in charge, Tyrone wouldn't protect the women. Something very terrible would happen, and because the Island of the Exiles only receives supplies from Ellandyr once in a great while, there would be no repercussions if something bad were to happen. Even the four murders, he explained, would go entirely unnoticed by Ellandyr until a supply ship arrived. And even then, would Ellandyr care? No, Stavros snorted, any manner of crimes could be committed by Tyrone and his followers. The situation was dangerous.</p>



<p>The rest of us went into the jungle. Actaeon had the antikythera search for the burned tree and we followed his path as he and Father sliced through the thicket. Unlike the jungles of the Island of the Dragon, this one didn't honestly take that long for us to get through. The island is small, to be sure. But goodness, it's hot and sticky in here. Tel, Malkarian, Leu, and Yzzy have it easy - they can just fly and avoid all the fauna. Whenever we do this - cutting through a jungle, I mean - I often look to Clio or Briar to see how they're faring. Briar likes plants, and Clio <em>is</em> a plant sort of. Does it bother them when we do this?</p>



<p>Perhaps only half an hour passed before the antikythera led us to the cave. There it was, all ominous, with the burned tree on the outside. We thought to inspect the tree and see why it was burned, but we had pressing matters to attend to. Clio put a spell of invisibility on Shadow and he went in as quiet as he could. He signaled that the coast was clear and we filtered in slowly, all except Malkarian and Yzzy, whom we left as lookouts. Its too dark in here for me to see, though, so Tel helped guide me. Shadow considered allowing me to light my lantern, but changed his mind when he heard a noise at the back of the cave. We stopped and waited for him. </p>



<p>Clio read Shadow's mind and reported to the rest of us. He found the gorgon, the metal bull monster, but it was tied with old rusted chains. We wondered if one of the exiles bound him here and was using it to commit the murders. Clio had explained to us back on the Gjallarhorn that gorgons have a breath attack of some kind that can petrify a person. Shadow had to be cautious around the bound monster, lest it tried to turn him to stone with a short breath. </p>



<p>We heard a curse and some clanging, and I quickly lit my lantern. Shadow, still invisible by Clio's magic, had tried to cut into the gorgon's leg and extract some blood. It did not go well. The gorgon kicked him in the chest (though we couldn't see it), and Actaeon ran forward to help. The gorgon saw Actaeon coming and began kicking fiercely. One chain broke, then another, then another! In an instant, the gorgon was free of its binds, free to kill us and roam the island, killing everyone else and-</p>



<p>BOOM! A crack of lightning came from nowhere, and an arrow of energy shot from Shadow's invisible position. It struck the gorgon in the head and it collapsed, immediately dead. Shadow's invisibility wore off and we all looked at him. "I... I didn't mean for that to happen," he huffed. </p>



<p>That's my good father, not wanting to kill animals indiscriminately. But in his defense, Clio said this wasn't an animal. Scholarly manuals classified gorgons as monstrosities, and wicked ones at that. Certainly, we all agreed, this was the creature that was turning the exiles to stone. More importantly, Shadow pointed out, someone was bringing people <em>in here</em> for the creature to petrify, and then dragging their petrified bodies back out. We saw the tracks, tell tale signs of the truth. Someone bound this creature and used it to murder. </p>



<p>While Malkarian and Yzzy were on watch, the rest of us assisted Shadow and Clio in getting the stuff they needed from the dead gorgon. It was... honestly not that bad this time. Mostly when Shadow is cutting up one of his kills, it's very gory and bloody and just absolutely <em>the worst</em>. This wasn't so bad. The creature's hide was metal, and the body beneath it, though flesh and blood, was more <em>metallic</em> than I had anticipated. Even its blood that we collected in vials looked more like oil than what one would expect blood to be. With that finished, we briefly wondered if we should wait for the murderer to come back here. We would trap them and force a confession.</p>



<p>That didn't happen. Malkarian came in and shouted, "There's someone out there! They saw us! Yzzy is chasing them down!" Shadow wasted no time! He picked up his bow and dashed out the door. When we caught up, we found one of the exiles on the ground with Yzzy and Shadow nearby, ready to strike. The man was Keelan, one of the exiles who had been with Stavros on the beach. Shadow and Yzzy tied him up and...</p>



<p>He just confessed. Keelan confessed to everything. We didn't pressure him at all. He was off in the jungle one day and came upon the cave. He went spelunking and found the sleeping gorgon. Keelan, a big and strong man, wrestled the beast. In the skirmish, he found the old and rusted chains on the ground - relics of whoever brought the gorgon to the Island of the Exiles in the first place - and used them to tie up the gorgon. Then, he killed people. He brought them in, one at a time, either under the guise of friendship or through force, and caused the gorgon to breathe on them, turning them to stone. He then drug their petrified bodies out of the cave and placed them where they'd cause the most panic amongst the exiles.</p>



<p>We asked why, and Keelan did not hesitate. "I want to kill them, all of the exiles. Corruption, oath breaking, murder, we are the worst of the people of Ellandyr. We don't deserve to be here. We deserve to be dead. We play nice, we elect a king to support us, we make friends with the sailors from the supply ships - for what? The Courts were too craven to commit us to the axe."</p>



<p>We chastised him for taking justice into his own hands, but he balked. He said he had no intention of making things right. He simply wants what justice would have of the world - that all the exiles are punished <em>properly</em> for their crimes. Even Acastus's mother should be put to death, he says, for manipulation of king. There is no salvation for Keelan or the exiles, says he. </p>



<p>We made our way back to the village of the exiles, prisoner in tow. The exiles were astonished to learn that Keelan - a normally calm and demure man - was the one sentencing them to death. Keelan freely admitted it to everyone, and he almost seemed relieved to speak the truth, that he hated the island and everyone on it. Stavros banished him from the village, a sentence that meant Keelan would have to survive on his own in the jungle instead of the village. But Keelan just shrugged. He didn't gather anything from his residence. He just left, walking away at a casual pace, unbothered by the banishment.</p>



<p>Briar followed him. "How did you subdue the gorgon? I didn't see it, but I understand that it's a monster, and not a small one at that." Keelan answered with a frown. He had been trying to find a place to live in a self-imposed exile from the exiles, and happened upon the gorgon. He was a wrestler and a bounty hunter in Ellandyr before his sentencing. His crime, he admitted, was one of passion. Keelan and his brother both fancied the same woman, and he murdered his brother for it. Grappling and sneaking was in his skillset.</p>



<p>Briar made an offer. She asked him to swear an oath to serve us and he could use his skills for good instead of wickedness. But Keelan laughed at her. "I beat my brother's skull in. And over what, a pretty girl? No one needs my skills. No one needs <em>me</em>. Everyone has demons, lass, but I am the demon. I took a life, and a life is owed. I should die, simple as that. But even Stavros and that lot won't execute me. And neither will you, it seems."</p>



<p>Briar was defeated and said that we'll look elsewhere for aid in the war. But this piqued his interest. Keelan asked about the war. He knew of the oath of peace as did everyone in Ellandyr. This was the first time he heard that the titans were going to raze Ellandyr once it had ended. He mocked our quest and asked if we truly thought we could beat the titans. Briar simply said, "It's not a matter of thinking. We <em>have to</em>. Thousands and thousands of people will die, all because the Lord of Storms wills it. We need people with skills, people with abilities. We need people who are willing to try, to make amends for their past. Someone who can grapple or sneak or bounty hunt, even if they were a murderer in the past, might save countless lives."</p>



<p>Keelan thought hard about this and marched back to the village. He asked us if what Briar said was true, and we confirmed it. He then turned to Briar and said, "I should have been put to death. I wasn't. A karmic debt is upon me, one greater than I could ever possibly bear. If you can guarantee that my utility to your cause will end with my blood spilled and my life over, I am yours. I will kill who you want killed. I will find who you want found. So long as my life ends the way it should, I swear by an oath of service to you that I will do as you ask of me."</p>



<p>Briar solemnly accepted Keelan's oath of service. And it was strange, the look we saw on both their faces. Briar understood the oath. He was bound to her like I was bound to the Book of the Dead. She understood that someday she would have to send Keelan to die. Keelan felt the shackles holding him to the Island of the Exiles come undone, and he was now free to step foot off the island, no longer bound forever to live amongst the people he hated so. His breathing changed and... I almost don't know how to describe it. Was it relief on his face, or worry? I think perhaps it was just acceptance. Acceptance that his blood would atone for his crimes someday soon.</p>



<p>The mystery of the murders of the Island of the Exiles was solved. We have a new ally, and we have gorgon's blood - everything we need for Clio to weave herself a cloak of protection. All that was left was Palladia's lute. We just have to wait until that Tyrone comes back with more information.</p>
